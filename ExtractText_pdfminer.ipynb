For purposes of calculating the ADP, Employer Contributions on behalf of any Participant will include: 1) any Elective Deferrals (other than Catch-up Contributions) made pursuant to the Participant’s salary deferral election or pursuant to automatic Elective Deferral enrollment, if applicable (including Excess Elective Deferrals of Highly Compensated Employees), but excluding Excess Elective Deferrals of Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees that arise solely from Elective Deferrals made under the Plan or plans of this Employer. For purposes of computing Actual Deferral Percentages, an Employee who would be a Participant but for the failure to make Elective Deferrals will be treated as a Participant on whose behalf no Elective Deferrals are made.Adopting Employer Means any corporation, sole proprietor, or other entity named in the Adoption Agreement and any successor who by merger, consolidation, purchase, or otherwise assumes the obligations of the Plan. The Adopting Employer will be a named ﬁ duciary for purposes of ERISA section 402(a).Adoption Agreement Means the document executed by the Adopting Employer through which it adopts the Plan and trust and thereby agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions of the Plan and trust. Alternate PayeeMeans any Spouse, former Spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant who is recognized by a Domestic Relations Order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the beneﬁ ts payable under the Plan with respect to such Participant.Annual AdditionsMeans the sum of the following amounts credited to a Participant for the Limitation Year: a. Employer Contributions; b. nondeductible employee contributions; c. amounts allocated to an individual medical account, as deﬁ ned in Code section 415(l)(2), that is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the Employer, and amounts derived from contribu-tions paid or accrued that are attributable to post-retirement medi-cal beneﬁ ts, allocated to the separate account of a key employee (as deﬁ ned in Code section 419A(d)(3)), under a welfare beneﬁ t fund (as deﬁ ned in Code section 419(e)), maintained by the Employer; d. amounts allocated under a simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan; ande. Excess Contributions (including amounts recharacterized).Annuity Starting DateMeans the ﬁ rst day of the ﬁ rst period for which an amount is paid as an annuity or in any other form.Basic Plan DocumentMeans this prototype Plan and trust document.Beneﬁ ciaryMeans the individual(s) or entity(ies) designated pursuant to Plan Section Five.Break in Eligibility ServiceMeans a 12-consecutive month period that coincides with an Eligibility Computation Period during which an Employee fails to complete more than 500 Hours of Service. Catch-up ContributionsMeans Elective Deferrals made pursuant to Plan Section Three that are in excess of an otherwise applicable Plan limit and that are made by Participants who are age 50 or older by the end of their taxable year. An otherwise applicable Plan limit is a limit in the Plan that applies to Elective Deferrals without regard to Catch-up Contributions, such as the limits on Annual Additions, the dollar limitation on Elective Deferrals under Code section 402(g) (not counting Catch-up Contributions), the limit imposed by the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) test under Code section 401(k)(3), or any other allowable limit imposed by the Employer. Catch-up Contributions for a Participant for a taxable year may not exceed (1) the dollar limit on Catch-up Contributions under Code section 414(v)(2)(B)(i) for the taxable year or (2) when added to other Elective Deferrals, an amount that would enable the Employer to satisfy other statutory or regulatory requirements (e.g., income tax withholding, FICA and FUTA withholding). The dollar limit on Catch-up Contributions in Code section 414(v)(2)(B)(i) is $1,000 for taxable years beginning in 2002, increasing by $1,000 for each year there-after up to $5,000 for taxable years beginning in 2006 and later years. After 2006, the $5,000 limit will be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living increases under Code section 414(v)(2)(C). Any such adjustments will be in multiples of $500. CodeMeans the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended from time to time. CompensationA. General Deﬁ nition—The following deﬁ nition of Compensation will apply. W-2 wages. Compensation is deﬁ ned as information required to be reported under Code sections 6041, 6051, and 6052 (wages, tips, and other compensation as reported on Form W-2). Compensation is further deﬁ ned as wages within the meaning of Code section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an Employee by the Employer (in the course of the Employer’s trade or business) for which the Employer is required to furnish the Employee a written statement under Code sec-tions 6041(d), 6051(a)(3), and 6052. Compensation must be determined without regard to any rules in Code section 3401(a) that limit the remu-neration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employ-ment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code section 3401(a)(2)). For any Self-Employed Individual covered under the Plan, Compensation will mean Earned Income. B. Determination Period And Other Rules—Where an Employee becomes an eligible Participant on any date subsequent to the ﬁ rst day of the applicable Determination Period, Compensation shall include that Compensation paid to the Employee during the entire Determination Period, unless otherwise required by either the Code or ERISA. Compensation received by an Employee during a Determination Period in which the Employee does not perform services for the Employer will be disregarded.Compensation will include any amount that is contributed by the Employer pursuant to a salary reduction agreement and that is not includible in the gross income of the Employee under Code sections 125, 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), or 403(b).

Compensation paid or made available during such Limitation Year will include any elective deferral (as deﬁ ned in Code section 402(g)(3)) and any amount that is contributed or deferred by the Employer at the elec-tion of the Employee and that is not includible in the gross income of the Employee by reason of Code sections 125, 132(f), or 457. Payments made after Severance from Employment will be included in Compensation within the meaning of Compensation as described in Part A of the deﬁ nition of Compensation in the Plan’s Deﬁ nition section, if they meet the following requirements:1. Payments described in paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) below will be included in the deﬁ nition of Compensation (within the meaning of Compensation as described in Part A of this deﬁ nition of Compensation) provided such payments meet the following requirements:a. Those amounts are paid by the later of 1) 2½ months after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan or 2) the end of the Limitation Year that includes the date of Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan; andb. Those amounts would have been included in the deﬁ nition of Compensation if they were paid before the Employee’s Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan. A governmental plan (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(d)) may provide for the substitution of the calendar year in which the Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan occurs for the Limitation Year in which the Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan occurs.2. Regular Pay. An amount is described in this paragraph (2) if a. The payment is regular compensation for services during the Employee’s regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the Employee’s regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar payments; andb. The payment would have been paid to the Employee prior to a Severance from Employment if the Employee had continued in employment with the Employer.3. Leave Cashouts. An amount is described in this paragraph (3) if a. The payment is for unused accrued bona ﬁ de sick, vacation, or other leave, but only if the Employee would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued.4. Deferred Compensation. An amount is described in this paragraph (4) if a. The payment is an amount received by an Employee pursuant to a nonqualiﬁ ed unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid to the Employee at the same time if the Employee had continued in employment with the Employer and only to the extent that the payment is includible in the Employee’s gross income.5. Other post-severance payments. Any payment that is not described in paragraph (2), (3), or (4) above is not considered Compensation under paragraph (1) above if paid after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan, even if it is paid within the time period described in paragraph (1) above. Thus, Compensation does not include severance pay, or parachute payments within the meaning of Code section 280G(b)(2), if they are paid after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan, and does not include post-severance payments under a nonqualiﬁ ed unfunded deferred compensation plan unless the payments would have been paid at that time without regard to the Severance from Employment. Any payments not described above are not considered Compensation if paid after Severance from Employment, even if they are paid within 2½ months following Severance from Employment, except for pay-ments to an individual who does not currently perform services for the Employer by reason of qualiﬁ ed military service (within the mean-ing of Code section 414(u)(1)) to the extent these payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the indi-vidual had continued to perform services for the Employer rather than entering qualiﬁ ed military service.C. Compensation for ADP and Code section 401(a)(4) Testing—Compensation for purposes of ADP and Code section 401(a)(4) testing will generally be W-2 wages unless another deﬁ nition is required by law or regulation. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Plan Administrator has the option from year to year to use a different deﬁ nition of Compensation for testing purposes provided the deﬁ nition of Compensation satisﬁ es Code section 414(s) and the corresponding regulations. D. Limits On Compensation—The annual Compensation of each Participant taken into account in determining allocations will not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code section 401(a)(17)(B). Annual Compensation means Compensation during the Plan Year or such other consecutive 12-month period over which Compensation is otherwise determined under the Plan (Determination Period). The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for the calendar year applies to annual Compensation for the Determination Period that begins with or within such calendar year.If a Determination Period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual Compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual Compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short Determination Period, and the denominator of which is 12.If Compensation for any prior Determination Period is taken into account in determining an Employee’s allocations or beneﬁ ts for the current Determination Period, the Compensation for such prior Determination Period is subject to the applicable annual Compensation limit in effect for that prior period.E. Elective Deferrals—Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the con-trary, with respect to Compensation that is paid (or would have been paid but for a cash or deferred election) in Plan Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, a Participant may only make Elective Deferrals from Compensation within the meaning of Compensation as described in Part A of this deﬁ nition of Compensation.F. Differential Wage Payments—Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if the Employer chooses to provide Differential Wage Payments to individuals who are active duty members of the uniformed services, such individuals will be treated as Employees of the Employer making the Differential Wage Payment and the Differential Wage Payment will be treated as Compensation for purposes of applying the Code. Accordingly, Differential Wage Payments must be treated as Compensation as described in Part A of this deﬁ nition of Compensation. Differential Wage Payments will also be treated as Compensation for contribution, allocation, and other general Plan purposes, unless excluded from the Plan’s deﬁ nition of Compensation on the Adoption Agreement. In addition, the Plan will not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of any provision described in Code section 414(u)(1)(C) by reason of any contribution or beneﬁ t that is based on Differential Wage Payments only if all Employees of the Employer (as determined under Code sections 414(b), (c), (m), and (o)) performing service in the uniformed services described in Code section 3401(h)(2)(A) are entitled to receive Differential Wage Payments on reasonably equivalent terms and, if eligible to partici-pate in the Plan, to make contributions based on the payments on rea-sonably equivalent terms applying the provisions of Code section 410(b)(3), (4), and (5). Such contributions or beneﬁ ts may be taken into account for purposes of nondiscrimination testing as long as they do not cause the Plan to fail the nondiscrimination requirements.Contributing ParticipantMeans a Participant who has enrolled as a Contributing Participant pursu-ant to Plan Section 3.01 and on whose behalf the Employer is contribut-ing Elective Deferrals to the Plan.CustodianMeans an entity appointed in the Adoption Agreement (or, if applicable, in a separate custodial agreement) by the Adopting Employer to hold the \fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-124-5 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The Directed Trustee will be responsible for investing the Fund and performing the responsibilities of the Trustee set forth in the Plan in accordance with speciﬁ c instructions provided by the Adopting Employer or the Plan Administrator (or Participant or Beneﬁ ciary) in accor-dance with instructions (either in writing or in any other form permitted by rules promulgated by the IRS or DOL) from one of the foregoing.

Distribution Calendar Year Means a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the Participant’s death, the ﬁ rst Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year that contains the Participant’s Required Beginning Date. For distributions beginning after the Participant’s death, the ﬁ rst Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to Plan Section 5.05(D). The required minimum distribu-tion for the Participant’s ﬁ rst Distribution Calendar Year will be made on or before the Participant’s Required Beginning Date. The required mini-mum distribution for other Distribution Calendar Years, including the required minimum distribution for the Distribution Calendar Year in which the Participant’s Required Beginning Date occurs, will be made on or before December 31 of that Distribution Calendar Year.Domestic Relations OrderMeans any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) that: a. relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a Participant, andb. is made pursuant to state domestic relations law (including appli-cable community property laws).Earliest Retirement Age Means, for purposes of the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity provisions of the Plan, the earliest date on which, under the Plan, the Participant could elect to receive retirement beneﬁ ts.Earned IncomeMeans the net earnings from self-employment in the trade or business with respect to which the Plan is established, for which personal services of the individual are a material income-producing factor. Net earnings will be determined without regard to items not included in gross income and the deductions allocable to such items.

Net earnings will be determined with regard to the deduction allowed to the Employer by Code section 164(f). For purposes of applying the limitations of Code section 415, in the case of an Employee who is an Employee within the meaning of Code section 401(c)(1) and regulations promulgated under Code section 401(c)(1), the Employee’s earned income (as described in Code section 401(c)(2) and regulations promulgated under Code section 401(c)(2)), will include amounts deferred at the election of the Employee that would be includ-ible in gross income but for the rules of Code sections 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b).Effective DateMeans the date the Plan (or amendment or restatement of the Plan) becomes effective as indicated in the Adoption Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding, unless otherwise provided in this Basic Plan Document, the Effective Date of mandatory Plan changes resulting from the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) and other legislative and regulatory guidance not previously included in the Plan will be the later of the original Effective Date of the Plan or the ﬁ rst day the legislative or regulatory change became effective. For optional changes made available by PPA and other legislative and regulatory guidance, the Effective Date will be the date the Plan began to operate in accordance with such optional change, as indicated by a Plan amendment if a written amend-ment was required for such change.Election PeriodMeans the period that begins on the ﬁ rst day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 35 and ends on the date of the Participant’s death.

Elective Deferrals will not include any defer-rals properly distributed as Excess Annual Additions. No Participant will be permitted to have Elective Deferrals made under this Plan, or any other qualiﬁ ed plan maintained by the Employer, during any taxable year of the Participant, in excess of the dollar limitation contained in Code section 402(g) in effect at the beginning of such taxable year. In the case of a Participant age 50 or over by the end of the taxable year, the dollar limitation described in the preceding sentence is increased by the amount of Elective Deferrals that can be Catch-up Contributions. The dollar limitation contained in Code section 402(g) is $10,500 for taxable years beginning in 2000 and 2001, increasing to $11,000 for taxable years beginning in 2002, and increasing by $1,000 for each year thereafter up to $15,000 for taxable years beginning in 2006 and later years. After 2006, the $15,000 limit will be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living increases under Code section 402(g)(4). Any adjustments will be in multiples of $500. Eligibility Computation PeriodMeans, with respect to an Employee’s initial Eligibility Computation Period, the 12-consecutive month period commencing on the Employee’s Employment Commencement Date. The Employee’s subsequent Eligibility Computation Periods will be the Plan Year commencing with the Plan Year beginning during the Employee’s initial Eligibility Computation Period. An Employee will not be credited with a Year of Eligibility Service before the end of the 12-consecutive month period regardless of when during such period the Employee completes the required number of Hours of Service.Eligible Retirement Plan Means, for purposes of the Direct Rollover provisions of the Plan, an individual retirement account described in Code sections 408(a) or 408A, an individual retirement annuity described in Code section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code section 403(a), an annuity contract described in Code section 403(b), an eligible plan under Code section 457(b) that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or an agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state (and that agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan), or a qualiﬁ ed plan described in Code section 401(a) that accepts the Recipient’s Eligible Rollover Distribution. The deﬁ nition of Eligible Retirement Plan will also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving Spouse, or to a Spouse or former Spouse who is the Alternate Payee under a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order, as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(p).If any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution is attributable to pay-ments or distributions from a designated Roth account, an Eligible Retirement Plan with respect to such portion will include only another designated Roth account of the individual from whose account the pay-ments or distributions were made, or a Roth IRA of such individual.Eligible Rollover Distribution Means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the Recipient, except that an Eligible Rollover Distribution does not includea. any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal peri-odic payments (paid at least annually) made for the life (or Life Expectancy) of the Recipient or the joint lives (or joint life expectan-cies) of the Recipient and the Recipient’s Designated Beneﬁ ciary, or for a speciﬁ ed period of ten years or more; b. any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Code section 401(a)(9);c. the portion of any other distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unreal-ized appreciation with respect to employer securities); d. any hardship distribution described in Plan Section 5.01(C)(2); ande. any other distribution(s) that is reasonably expected to total less than $200 during a year.For distributions made after December 31, 2001, a portion of a distri-bution will not fail to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Code section 408(a) or (b), or a Roth individual retirement account or annuity described in Code Section 408A (a Roth IRA), or to a qualiﬁ ed deﬁ ned contribution plan described in Code section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includ-ible in gross income and the portion of such distribution that is not so includible.Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely for purposes of applying the Direct Rollover distribution provisions of the Plan, 2009 RMDs and Extended 2009 RMDs distributed for 2009 were treated as Eligible Rollover Distributions.EmployeeMeans any person employed by an Employer maintaining the Plan or by any other employer required to be aggregated with such Employer under Code sections 414(b), (c), (m), or (o).The term Employee will also include any Leased Employee deemed to be an Employee of any Employer described in the previous paragraph as provided in Code sections 414(n) or (o).The term Employee will also include individuals providing qualiﬁ ed military service who are treated as reemployed for purposes of applying the rules under Code sections 401(a)(37) and 414(u).EmployerMeans the Adopting Employer and all Related Employers of the Adopting Employer.

Employer Proﬁ t Sharing ContributionMeans an Employer Contribution made pursuant to the Adoption Agreement Section titled “Employer Proﬁ t Sharing Contributions.” The Employer may make Employer Proﬁ t Sharing Contributions without regard to current or accumulated earnings or proﬁ ts.Employment Commencement DateMeans, with respect to an Employee, the date such Employee ﬁ rst per-forms an Hour of Service for the Employer.Entry DatesMeans the ﬁ rst day of the Plan Year and the ﬁ rst day of the seventh month of the Plan Year coinciding with or following the date the Employee satisﬁ es the eligibility requirements of Plan Section 2.01 for the appli-cable contribution source or as such other times established by the Plan Administrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. Additionally, if this is an initial adoption of the Plan by the Employer, the initial Effective Date will also be considered an Entry Date.ERISAMeans the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended from time to time.

Each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, is either awarded or agreed to by the Employer. The same Hours of Service will not be credited both under paragraph (1) or paragraph (2), as the case may be, and under this paragraph (3). These hours will be credited to the Employee for the computation period or peri-ods to which the award or agreement pertains rather than the com-putation period in which the award, agreement, or payment is made. 4. Solely for purposes of determining whether a Break in Eligibility Service has occurred in a computation period, an individual who is absent from work for maternity or paternity reasons will receive credit for the Hours of Service that would otherwise have been credited to such individual but for such absence, or in any case in which such hours cannot be determined, eight Hours of Service per day of such absence.

The Hours of Service credited under this paragraph will be credited 1) in the Eligibility Computation Period or Plan Year in which the absence begins if the crediting is necessary to prevent a Break in Eligibility Service in the applicable period, or 2) in all other cases, in the following Eligibility Computation Period or Plan Year. 5. Hours of Service will be credited for employment with other mem-bers of an afﬁ liated service group (under Code section 414(m)), a controlled group of corporations (under Code section 414(b)), or a group of trades or businesses under common control (under Code section 414(c)) of which the Adopting Employer is a member, and any other entity required to be aggregated with the Employer pursuant to Code section 414(o) and the corresponding regulations.  Hours of Service will also be credited for any individual considered an Employee for purposes of this Plan under Code sections 414(n) or 414(o) and the corresponding regulations. 6. Where the Employer maintains the plan of a predecessor employer, service for such predecessor employer will be treated as service for the Employer. If the Employer does not maintain the plan of a prede-cessor employer, service for such predecessor employer will not be treated as service for the Employer. Indirect RolloverMeans a rollover contribution received by this Plan from an Employee that previously received a distribution from this Plan or another plan rather than having such amount directly rolled over to this Plan from the distrib-uting plan.Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-128-9 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Qualiﬁ ed Election Means a waiver of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or a Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity. Any waiver of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or a Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity will not be effective unless 1) the Participant’s Spouse consents to the election (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL), 2) the election designates a speciﬁ c Beneﬁ ciary, including any class of beneﬁ ciaries or any contingent beneﬁ ciaries, that may not be changed without spousal consent (or the Spouse expressly permits designations by the Participant without any further spousal con-sent), 3) the Spouse’s consent acknowledges the effect of the election, and d) the Spouse’s consent is witnessed by a Plan representative or notary public. Additionally, a Participant’s waiver of the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity will not be effective unless the election designates a form of beneﬁ t payment that may not be changed without spousal con-sent (or the Spouse expressly permits designations by the Participant without any further spousal consent). If it is established to the satisfac-tion of a Plan representative that there is no Spouse or that the Spouse cannot be located, a waiver by the Participant will be deemed a Qualiﬁ ed Election. In addition, if the Spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, the Spouse’s legal guardian, even if the guardian is the Participant, may give consent. If the Participant is legally separated or the Participant has been abandoned (within the meaning of local law) and the Participant has a court order to such effect, spousal consent is not required unless a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order provides otherwise. Any consent by a Spouse obtained under this provision (or establishment that the consent of a Spouse may not be obtained) will be effective only with respect to such Spouse. A consent that permits designations by the Participant without any requirement of further consent by such Spouse must acknowledge that the Spouse has the right to limit consent to a speciﬁ c Beneﬁ ciary, and a speciﬁ c form of beneﬁ t where applicable, and that the Spouse voluntarily elects to relinquish either or both of such rights. A revocation of a prior waiver may be made by a Participant with-out the consent of the Spouse at any time before the commencement of beneﬁ ts. The number of revocations will not be limited. No consent obtained under this provision will be valid unless the Participant has received notice as provided in Plan Section 5.10(D).Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity Means an immediate annuity for the life of the Participant with a survivor annuity for the life of the Spouse that is not less than 50 percent and not more than 100 percent of the amount of the annuity that is payable during the joint lives of the Participant and the Spouse and that is the amount of beneﬁ t that can be purchased with the Participant’s vested account balance. The percentage of the survivor annuity under the Plan will be 50 percent.Qualiﬁ ed Optional Survivor Annuity Means an annuity 1) for the life of the Participant with a survivor annuity for the life of the Spouse that is equal to the “applicable percentage” of the amount of the annuity that is payable during the joint lives of the Participant and the Spouse, and 2) that is the actuarial equivalent of a single annuity for the life of the Participant. If the survivor annuity pro-vided by the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is less than 75 percent of the annuity payable during the joint lives of the Participant and the Spouse, the applicable percentage is 75 percent. If the survivor annuity provided by the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is greater than or equal to 75 percent, the applicable percentage is 50 percent.Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor AnnuityMeans a survivor annuity for the life of the surviving Spouse of the Participant if the payments are not less than the amounts that would be payable as a survivor annuity under the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity under the Plan in accordance with Code section 417(c).

Notwithstanding the preceding, for purposes of calculating the top-heavy ratio, the Valuation Date will be the last day of the initial Plan Year and the last day of the preceding Plan Year for each subsequent Plan Year.Year of Eligibility ServiceMeans a 12-consecutive month period that coincides with an Eligibility Computation Period during which an Employee completes at least 1,000 Hours of Service. Employees are not credited with a Year of Eligibility Service until they complete the required number of Hours of Service and reach the end of the 12-consecutive month period.Section One: Effective DatesPursuant to the DEFINITIONS Section of the Plan, the Effective Date means the date the Plan becomes effective as indicated in the Adoption Agreement. However, certain provisions of the Plan may have effective dates different from the Plan Effective Date, if, for example, the Plan is amended after the Effective Date. Section Two: Eligibility Requirements2.01 Eligibility to ParticipateEach Employee, except an Employee who belongs to a class of Employees excluded from participation, shall be eligible to participate in this Plan upon satisfying the age and eligibility service requirements speciﬁ ed in the Adoption Agreement. If no age is speciﬁ ed in the Adoption Agreement, there will not be an age requirement. If no option for eligibility service is selected, no eligibility service will be required.The following Employees will be excluded from participation in the Plan.A. Union Employees—Employees included in a unit of Employees cov-ered by a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and Employee representatives, if retirement beneﬁ ts were the subject of good faith bargaining and if two-percent or less of the Employees who are covered pursuant to that agreement are professionals as deﬁ ned in Treasury Regulation section 1.410(b)-9. For this purpose, the term “Employee representatives” does not include any organization in which more than half of the members are Employees who are owners, ofﬁ cers, or executives of the Employer.B. Non-resident Aliens—Employees who are non-resident aliens (within the meaning of Code section 7701(b)(1)(B)) who received no earned income (within the meaning of Code section 911(d)(2)) from the Employer that constitutes income from sources within the United States (within the meaning of Code section 861(a)(3)).C. Acquired Employees—Employees who became Employees as the result of certain acquisitions or dispositions as described under Code section 410(b)(6)(C). Such Employees will be excluded from participation during the transition period beginning on the date of the change in the members of the group and ending on the last day of the ﬁ rst Plan Year that begins after the date of the change. A transaction under Code section 410(b)(6)(C) is an asset or stock acquisition, merger, or similar transaction involving a change in the employer of the employees of a trade or business.2.02 Plan EntryA. Plan Restatement—If this Plan is an amendment or restatement of a Prior Plan Document, each Employee who was a Participant under the Prior Plan Document before the Effective Date will continue to be a Participant in this Plan.B. Effective Date—If this is an initial adoption of the Plan by the Employer, an Employee will become a Participant in the Plan as of the Effective Date if the Employee has met the eligibility requirements of Plan Section 2.01 as of such date. After the Effective Date, each Employee will become a Participant on the ﬁ rst Entry Date coinciding with or following the date the Employee satisﬁ es the eligibility require-ments of Plan Section 2.01 for the applicable contribution source.C. Notiﬁ cation—The Plan Administrator shall notify each Employee who becomes eligible to be a Participant under this Plan and shall furnish the Employee with the enrollment forms or other documents that are required of Participants. Such notiﬁ cation will be in writing, or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS or DOL. The Employee will execute such forms or documents and make available such information as may be required in the administration of the Plan. 2.03 Transfer to or from an Ineligible ClassIf an Employee who had been a Participant becomes ineligible to partici-pate because they are no longer a member of an eligible class of Employees, but has not incurred a Break in Eligibility Service, such Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1212-13 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

If such Employee incurs a Break in Eligibility Service, their eligibility to partici-pate will be determined by Plan Section 2.04. An Employee who is not a member of the eligible class of Employees will become a Participant immediately upon becoming a member of the eligible class, provided such Employee has satisﬁ ed the age and eligibil-ity service requirements. If such Employee has not satisﬁ ed the age and eligibility service requirements as of the date they become a mem-ber of the eligible class, such Employee will become a Participant on the ﬁ rst Entry Date coinciding with or following the date they satisfy those requirements. 2.04 Return as a Participant After a Break in Eligibility ServiceA. Employee Not a Participant Before Break—If an Employee incurs a Break in Eligibility Service before satisfying the Plan’s eligibility require-ments, such Employee’s eligibility service before such Break in Eligibility Service will not be taken into account. B. Employee a Participant Before Break—If a Participant incurs a Break in Eligibility Service, such Participant will continue to participate in the Plan, or, if terminated, will participate immediately following the date of reemployment. 2.05 Determinations Under This SectionThe Plan Administrator will determine the eligibility of each Employee to be a Participant. This determination will be conclusive and binding upon all persons except as otherwise provided herein or by law. 2.06 Terms of EmploymentNothing with respect to the establishment of the Plan and trust or any action taken with respect to the Plan, nor the fact that a common law Employee has become a Participant will give to that Employee any right to employment or continued employment or to grant any other rights except as speciﬁ cally set forth in this Plan document, ERISA, or other applicable law; nor will the Plan or trust limit the right of the Employer to discharge an Employee or to otherwise deal with an Employee with-out regard to the effect such treatment may have upon the Employee’s rights under the Plan. Section Three: Contributions3.01 Elective DeferralsEach Employee who satisﬁ es the eligibility requirements speciﬁ ed in the Adoption Agreement may begin making such Elective Deferrals to the Plan by enrolling as a Contributing Participant.A. Requirements to Enroll as a Contributing Participant—Each Employee who satisﬁ es the eligibility requirements speciﬁ ed in the Adoption Agreement, may enroll as a Contributing Participant, on the ﬁ rst Entry Date coinciding with or following the date the Employee satisﬁ es the eligibility requirements, or if applicable, the ﬁ rst Entry Date following the date on which the Employee returns to the eligible class of Employees pursuant to Plan Section 2.03. A Participant who wishes to enroll as a Contributing Participant must deliver (either in writing or in any other form permitted by the IRS and the DOL) a salary reduction agreement to the Plan Administrator. Except for occasional, bona ﬁ de administrative considerations as set forth in the Treasury Regulations, contributions made pursuant to such election cannot precede the earlier of 1) the date on which services relating to the contribution are performed, and 2) the date on which the Compensation that is subject to the election would be payable to the Employee in the absence of an election to defer. If a Plan permits both Pre-Tax and Roth Elective Deferrals and the Participant fails to designate whether their Elective Deferrals are Pre-Tax or Roth Elective Deferrals, the Participant will be deemed to have desig-nated the Elective Deferrals as Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals.The Employer shall deposit Elective Deferrals with the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) as of such time as is required by the IRS and DOL.B. Ceasing Elective Deferrals—A Participant may cease Elective Deferrals and thus withdraw as a Contributing Participant as of any such times established by the Plan Administrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner by revoking the authorization to the Employer to make Elective Deferrals on their behalf. A Participant who desires to withdraw as a Contributing Participant will give notice of withdrawal to the Plan Administrator at least 30 days (or such shorter period as the Plan Administrator will permit in a uniform and nondiscriminatory man-ner) before the effective date of withdrawal. A Participant will cease to be a Contributing Participant upon their Termination of Employment or on account of termination of the Plan. C. Return as a Contributing Participant After Ceasing Elective Deferrals—A Participant who has withdrawn as a Contributing Participant (e.g., pursuant to Plan Section 3.01(B), a suspension due to a hardship distribution, or a suspension due to a distribution on account of a Deemed Severance from Employment) may not again become a Contributing Participant such times established by the Plan Administrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.D. Changing Elective Deferral Amounts—A Contributing Participant or a Participant who has met the eligibility requirements in the Adoption Agreement, but who has never made an afﬁ rmative election regarding Elective Deferrals, may complete a new or modify an existing salary reduction agreement to increase or decrease the amount of their Compensation deferred into the Plan or change the type of their future Elective Deferrals (Roth or Pre-Tax), if applicable. Such modiﬁ cation may be made as of such times established by the Plan Administrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. A modiﬁ cation that results in the amount of the Participant’s Compensation being deferred into the Plan being zero (0) will be considered a cessation of deferrals under the Plan. A Contributing Participant who desires to make such a modiﬁ cation will complete and deliver (either in writing or in any other form permitted by the IRS and the DOL) a new salary reduction agreement. The Plan Administrator may prescribe such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules as it deems appropriate to carry out the terms of this Plan Section 3.01(D).E. Pre-Tax Vs. Roth Elective Deferrals—If the Adopting Employer so elects in the Adoption Agreement, each Employee who enrolls as a Contributing Participant may specify whether their Elective Deferrals are to be characterized as Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals, Roth Elective Deferrals, or a speciﬁ ed combination. A Contributing Participant’s election will remain in effect until superseded by another election. Elective Deferrals contributed to the Plan as one type, either Roth or Pre-Tax, may not later be reclassiﬁ ed as the other type. A Contributing Participant’s Roth Elective Deferrals will be deposited in the Contributing Participant’s Roth Elective Deferral subaccount in the Plan. No contributions other than Roth Elective Deferrals and properly attributable earnings will be credited to each Contributing Participant’s Roth Elective Deferral account, and gains, losses, and other credits or charges will be allocated on a reason-able and consistent basis to such subaccount.F. Catch-up Contributions—All Employees who are eligible to make Elective Deferrals under this Plan and who are age 50 or older by the end of their taxable year will be eligible to make Catch-up Contributions. Catch-up Contributions are not subject to the limits on Annual Additions under Code section 415, are not counted in the ADP test, and are not counted in determining the minimum allocation under Code section 416 (but Catch-up Contributions made in prior years are counted in determin-ing whether the Plan is top-heavy). Provisions in the Plan relating to Catch-up Contributions apply to Elective Deferrals made after 2001.3.02 Employer ContributionsA. Obligation to Contribute—The Employer may contribute an amount to be determined from year to year. The Employer may, in its sole discre-tion, make contributions without regard to current or accumulated earn-ings or proﬁ ts. B. Allocation Formula and the Right to Share in the Employer Contribution 1. General—Employer Proﬁ t Sharing Contributions will be allocated to all Qualifying Participants using a pro rata allocation formula. Under the pro rata allocation formula, Employer Proﬁ t Sharing Contributions will be allocated to the Individual Accounts of Qualifying Participants \fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1212-13 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The Employer Contribution for any Plan Year will be deemed allocated to each Participant’s Individual Account as of the last day of that Plan Year.  Any Employer Contribution for a Plan Year must satisfy Code sec-tion 401(a)(4) and the corresponding Treasury Regulations for such Plan Year.2. Special Rule for Owner-Employees—If this Plan provides contribu-tions or beneﬁ ts for one or more Owner-Employees, contributions on behalf of any Owner-Employee may be made only with respect to the Earned Income of such Owner-Employee.3. Inclusion of Ineligible Employees—If any Employee who is not a Qualifying Participant is erroneously treated as a Qualifying Participant during a Plan Year, then, except as otherwise provided in Plan Section 3.02(F), the Employer will not be eligible to receive any portion of the contribution erroneously allocated to the Individual Account of the ineligible Employee. The Employer must correct the inclusion of ineligible employees using any method permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) or allowed by the IRS or DOL under regulations or other guidance. EPCRS is currently described in IRS Revenue Procedure 2013-12.4. Exclusion of Eligible Participant—If in any Plan Year, any Participant is erroneously excluded and discovery of such exclusion is not made until after the Employer Contribution has been made and allocated, then the Employer must contribute for the excluded Participant the amount, including earnings thereon, that the Employer should have contributed for the Participant. The Employer must correct the exclu-sion of eligible Participants using any method permitted under EPCRS or allowed by the IRS or DOL under regulations or other guidance. EPCRS is currently described in IRS Revenue Procedure 2013-12.C. Allocation of Forfeitures—A Participant’s Individual Account shall be nonforfeitable and 100 percent vested at all times. D. Timing of Employer Contribution—Unless otherwise speciﬁ ed in the Plan or permitted by law or regulation, the Employer Contribution made by an Employer for each Plan Year will be deposited with the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) not later than the due date for ﬁ ling the Employer’s income tax return for its tax year in which the Plan Year ends, including extensions thereof. Notwithstanding the preceding, Employer Contributions may be deposited during the Plan Year for which they are being made.E. Minimum Allocation for Top-Heavy Plans—The contribution and allo-cation provisions of this Plan Section 3.02(E) will apply for any Plan Year with respect to which this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan and will super-sede any conﬂ icting provisions in the Plan. 1. Except as otherwise provided in (3) and (4) below, the Employer Contributions allocated on behalf of any Participant who is not a Key Employee will not be less than the lesser of three-percent of such Participant’s Compensation or (in the case where the Employer does not maintain a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan in addition to this Plan that desig-nates this Plan to satisfy Code section 401 the largest percentage of Employer Contributions, as a percentage of the Key Employee’s Compensation, as limited by Code section 401(a)(17), allocated on behalf of any Key Employee for that year. The minimum allocation is determined without regard to any Social Security contribution. Only Participants who are not Key Employees will be entitled to receive the minimum allocation. For purposes of the preceding sentences, the largest percentage of Employer Contributions as a percentage of each Key Employee’s Compensation will be determined by treating Elective Deferrals as Employer Contributions. This minimum allocation will be made even though under other Plan provisions, the Participant would not otherwise be entitled to receive an allocation.2. For purposes of computing the minimum allocation, Compensation will mean compensation as provided in the Deﬁ nitions Section of the Plan as limited by Code section 401(a)(17) and will include any amounts contributed by the Employer pursuant to a salary reduction agreement and that is not includible in gross income under Code sections 402(g), 125, 132(f)(4), or 457. Compensation for the full Determin-ation Year will be used in calculating the minimum allocation. 3. The provision in (1) above will not apply to any Participant who was not employed by the Employer on the last day of the Plan Year. 4. The minimum allocation required under this Plan Section 3.02(E) (to the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Code section 416(b)) may not be forfeited under Code sections 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D).5. Elective Deferrals (and for Plan Years beginning before 2002, Matching Contributions) may be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the minimum allocation requirement applicable to Top-Heavy Plans described in Plan Section 3.02(E)(1). F. Return of the Employer Contribution to the Employer Under Special Circumstances—Any contribution made by the Employer because of a mistake of fact must be returned to the Employer within one year of the contribution. In the event that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determines that the Plan is not initially qualiﬁ ed under the Code, any contributions made incident to that initial qualiﬁ cation by the Employer must be returned to the Employer within one year after the date the initial qualiﬁ cation is denied, but only if the application for qualiﬁ cation is made by the time prescribed by law for ﬁ ling the Employer’s return for the taxable year in which the Plan is adopted, or such later date as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe. In the event that a contribution made by the Employer under this Plan is conditioned on deductibility and is not deductible under Code section 404, the contribution, to the extent of the amount disallowed, must be returned to the Employer within one year after the deduction is disallowed. If applicable, no contract will be purchased under the Plan unless such contract or a separate deﬁ nite written agreement between the Employer and the insurer provides that no value under contracts providing ben-eﬁ ts under the Plan or credits determined by the insurer (on account of dividends, earnings, or other experience rating credits, or surrender or cancellation credits) with respect to such contracts may be paid or returned to the Employer or diverted to or used for other than the exclu-sive beneﬁ t of the Participants or their Beneﬁ ciaries. However, any contribution made by the Employer because of a mistake of fact must be returned to the Employer within one year of the contribution.3.03 Rollover ContributionsAn Employee may make Indirect Rollover and Direct Rollover contribu-tions to the Plan from distributions made from plans described in Code sections 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, and 457(b) (if maintained by a governmental entity) (excluding nondeductible employee contributions) unless an Employee is a member of any excluded class pursuant to Plan Section 2.01. The Plan Administrator may require the Employee to cer-tify, either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promul-gated by the IRS and DOL, that the contribution qualiﬁ es as a rollover contribution under the applicable provisions of the Code. If it is later determined that all or part of a rollover contribution was ineligible to be contributed to the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto (deter-mined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be distributed from the Plan to the Employee as soon as administratively feasible.A separate account will be maintained by the Plan Administrator for each Employee’s rollover contributions, which will be nonforfeitable at all times. Such account will share in the income and gains and losses of the Fund in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B). The Employer may, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, allow only Employees who have become Participants in the Plan to make rollover contributions. 2009 RMDs and Extended 2009 RMDs distributed for 2009 were con-sidered Eligible Rollover Distributions and could have been rolled over to the Plan in accordance with this section.Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1214-15 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Whether any particular elective transfer will be accepted by the Plan will be determined using the uniform and nondiscriminatory rules estab-lished by the Plan Administrator, and the procedures for the receipt of such transfers by the Plan must be allowed under Code section 411(d)(6), Treasury Regulation section 1.411(d)-4, and other rules promulgated by the IRS. Nothing in this Plan prohibits the Plan Administrator from permitting (or prohibiting) Participants to transfer their Individual Accounts to other eligible plans, provided such transfers are permitted (or prohibited) in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. If it is later determined that all or part of an elective transfer was ineligible to be transferred into the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto (deter-mined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be distributed from the Plan to the Employee as soon as administratively feasible. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may, at its discretion, also return the amount transferred to the transferor plan or correct the ineligible transfer using any other method permitted by the IRS under regulation or other guidance.A separate account will be maintained by the Plan Administrator for each Employee’s elective transfers, which will, if applicable, be nonforfeitable at all times. Such account will share in the income and gains and losses of the Fund in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B). If elective transfers are associated with distributable events and the Employees are eligible to receive single sum distributions con-sisting entirely of Eligible Rollover Contributions, the elective transfers will be considered Direct Rollovers.3.05 Limitation on AllocationsA. If the Participant does not participate in, and has never participated in, another qualiﬁ ed plan maintained by the Employer, a welfare beneﬁ t fund (as deﬁ ned in Code section 419(e)) maintained by the Employer, an individual medical account (as deﬁ ned in Code section 415(l)(2)) main-tained by the Employer, or a simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan (as deﬁ ned in Code section 408(k)) maintained by the Employer, any of which provides an Annual Addition as deﬁ ned in the Deﬁ nitions Section of the Plan, the following rules will apply. 1. The amount of Annual Additions that may be credited to the Participant’s Individual Account for any Limitation Year will not exceed the lesser of the Maximum Permissible Amount or any other limitation contained in this Plan. If the Employer Contribution that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant’s Individual Account would cause the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year to exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount, the amount contributed or allocated may be reduced so that the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year will equal the Maximum Permissible Amount. 2. Before determining the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year, the Employer may determine the Maximum Permissible Amount for a Participant on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the Participant’s Compensation for the Limitation Year, uniformly determined for all Participants similarly situated. 3. As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the Limitation Year, the Maximum Permissible Amount for the Limitation Year will be determined on the basis of the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year. 4. Any Excess Annual Additions allocated to a Participant may be cor-rected through EPCRS or such other correction method allowed by statute, regulations, or regulatory authorities. EPCRS is currently described in IRS Revenue Procedure 2013-12.B. If, in addition to this Plan, the Participant is covered under another qualiﬁ ed master or prototype deﬁ ned contribution plan maintained by the Employer, a welfare beneﬁ t fund maintained by the Employer, an individual medical account maintained by the Employer, or a simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan maintained by the Employer any of which pro-vides an Annual Addition as deﬁ ned in the Deﬁ nitions Section of the Plan during any Limitation Year, the following rules apply.1. The Annual Additions that may be credited to a Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan for any such Limitation Year will not exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount, reduced by the Annual Additions credited to a Participant under the other qualiﬁ ed Master or Prototype Plans, welfare beneﬁ t funds, individual medical account, and simpliﬁ ed employee pension plans for the same Limitation Year. If the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under other qualiﬁ ed Master or Prototype deﬁ ned contribution plans, welfare beneﬁ t funds, individual medical accounts, and simpliﬁ ed employee pension plans maintained by the Employer are less than the Maximum Permissible Amount, and the Employer Contribution that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan would cause the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year to exceed this limitation, the amount contrib-uted or allocated may be reduced so that the Annual Additions under all such plans and funds for the Limitation Year will equal the Maximum Permissible Amount. If the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under such other qualiﬁ ed Master or Prototype deﬁ ned contribution plans, welfare beneﬁ t funds, individual medical accounts, and simpliﬁ ed employee pension plans in the aggregate are equal to or greater than the Maximum Permissible Amount, no amount will be contributed or allocated to the Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan for the Limitation Year.2. Before determining the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year, the Employer may determine the Maximum Permissible Amount for a Participant in the manner described in Plan Section 3.05(A)(2).3. As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the Limitation Year, the Maximum Permissible Amount for the Limitation Year will be determined on the basis of the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year.4. Any Excess Annual Additions attributed to this Plan will be disposed of in the manner described in Plan Section 3.05(A)(4).C. If the Participant is covered under another qualiﬁ ed deﬁ ned contri-bution plan maintained by the Employer, other than a Master or Prototype Plan, the provisions of Plan Section 3.05(B)(1) through 3.05(B)(4) will apply as if the other plan were a Master or Prototype Plan. In the event this method cannot be administered because of conﬂ icting language in the other plan, the Employer must provide, through a written attachment to the Plan, the method under which the plans will limit total Annual Additions to the Maximum Permissible Amount, and will properly reduce any Excess Annual Additions in a manner that precludes Employer discretion.3.06 Actual Deferral Percentage Test (ADP)A. Limits on Highly Compensated Employees—The Actual Deferral Percentage (hereinafter “ADP”) for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests.1. The ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year multi-plied by 1.25; or2. The ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year multiplied by 2.0 provided that the ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees by more than two percentage points. The prior-year testing method described below will apply to this Plan. \fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1214-15 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Prior-Year Testing—The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the prior year’s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests.a. The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the prior year’s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 1.25; orb. The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the prior year’s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 2.0, provided that the ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees in the prior Plan Year by more than two percentage points. For the ﬁ rst Plan Year that the Plan permits any Participant to make Elective Deferrals and if this is not a successor Plan, for purposes of the preceding tests, the prior year’s non-Highly Compensated Employees’ ADP will be three-percent. B. Special Rules1. A Participant is a Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if they meet the deﬁ nition of a Highly Compensated Employee in effect for that Plan Year. Similarly, a Participant is a non-Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if they do not meet the deﬁ nition of a Highly Compensated Employee in effect for that Plan Year.2. The ADP for any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year and who is eligible to have Elective Deferrals allo-cated to their Individual Accounts under two or more arrangements described in Code section 401(k) that are maintained by the Employer, will be determined as if such Elective Deferrals were made under a single arrangement. If a Highly Compensated Employee participates in two or more cash or deferred arrangements that have different Plan Years, all Elective Deferrals made during the Plan Year under all such arrangements will be aggregated. For Plan Years beginning before 2006, cash or deferred arrangements ending with or within the same calendar year will be treated as a single arrange-ment. Notwithstanding the preceding, certain plans will be treated as separate if mandatorily disaggregated under the Treasury Regulations under Code section 401(k).3. In the event that this Plan satisﬁ es the requirements of Code sec-tions 401(k), 401(a)(4), or 410(b) only if aggregated with one or more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements of such Code sections only if aggregated with this Plan, then this Plan Section 3.06(B)(3) will be applied by determining the ADP of Participants as if all such plans were a single plan. If more than ten-percent of the Employer’s non-Highly Compensated Employees are involved in a plan coverage change as deﬁ ned in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-2(c)(4), then any adjustments to the non-Highly Compensated Employee ADP for the prior year will be made in accordance with such regulations. Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy Code section 401(k) only if they have the same Plan Year and use the same ADP testing method. 4. For purposes of satisfying the ADP test, Elective Deferrals must be made before the end of the 12-month period immediately following the Plan Year to which contributions relate.5. The Employer shall maintain records sufﬁ cient to demonstrate satis-faction of the ADP test.6. The determination and treatment of the ADP amounts of any Participant will satisfy such other requirements as may be pre-scribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.7. In the event that the Plan Administrator determines that it is not likely that the ADP test will be satisﬁ ed for a particular Plan Year unless certain steps are taken before the end of such Plan Year, the Plan Administrator may require Contributing Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees to reduce or cease future Elective Deferrals for such Plan Year in order to satisfy that requirement. This limitation will be considered a Plan-imposed limit for Catch-up Contribution purposes. If the Plan Administrator requires Contributing Participants to reduce or cease making Elective Deferrals under this paragraph, the reduction or cessation will begin with the Highly Compensated Employee with either the largest amount of Elective Deferrals or the highest Contribution Percentage for the Plan Year (on the date on which it is determined that the ADP test will not likely be satisﬁ ed), as elected by the Plan Administrator. All remaining Highly Compensated Employees’ Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year will be limited to such amount. Notwithstanding the preceding, if it is later determined that the ADP test for the Plan Year will be satisﬁ ed, Highly Compensated Employees will be permitted to enroll again as Contributing Participants in accordance with the terms of the Plan.8. Elective Deferrals that are treated as Catch-up Contributions because they exceed a Plan limit or a statutory limit will be excluded from ADP testing. Amounts which are characterized as Catch–up Contributions as a result of the ADP test will reduce the amount of Excess Contributions distributed.Section Four: Vesting and ForfeituresAn Employee is 100 percent vested in their Individual Account which shall be nonforfeitable at all times.Section Five: Distributions and Loans to Participants5.01 DistributionsA. Eligibility for Distributions1. Entitlement to Distribution—A Participant’s Individual Account shall be distributable to the Participant upon the Participant’s Termination of Employment, attainment of Normal Retirement Age, Disability, attainment of age 59½, or the termination of the Plan. If a Participant who is entitled to a distribution is not legally competent to request or consent to a distribution, the Participant’s court-appointed guardian, an attorney-in-fact acting under a valid power of attorney, or any other individual or entity authorized under state law to act on behalf of the Participant, may request and accept a distri-bution of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan Section 5.01(A).2. Special Requirements for Certain 401(k) Contributions—Elective Deferrals and income allocable are not distributable to a Participant or their Beneﬁ ciary or Beneﬁ ciaries, in accordance with such Participant’s or Beneﬁ ciaries’ election, earlier than upon the Participant’s Severance from Employment, death, or Disability, except as listed below. Such amounts may also be distributed upon any one of the follow-ing events:a. termination of the Plan without the establishment of another deﬁ ned contribution plan, other than an employee stock ownership plan (as deﬁ ned in Code section 4975(e) or Code section 409), a simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan (as deﬁ ned in Code section 408(k)), a SIMPLE IRA Plan (as deﬁ ned in Code section 408(p)), a plan or contract described in Code section 403(b), or a plan described in Code section 457(b) or (f), at any time during the period beginning on the date of Plan termination and ending twelve months after all assets have been distributed from the Plan;b. attainment of age 59½ in the case of a proﬁ t sharing plan;c. existence of a hardship incurred by the Participant as described in Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(b); Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1216-17 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

If an individual receives a distribution due to a Deemed Severance from Employment, the individual may not make an Elective Deferral during the six-month period beginning on the date of the distribution; or e. a federally declared disaster as described in Plan Section 5.01(D)(3). All distributions that may be made pursuant to one or more of the preceding distribution eligibility requirements are subject to the spousal and Participant consent requirements (if applicable) con-tained in Code section 401(a)(11) and 417. In addition, distributions that are triggered by either a., b., or c. above must be made in a lump sum. For years beginning after 2005, if both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the year, the Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, may establish operational procedures, including ordering rules as permit-ted under the law and related regulations, that specify whether distributions, including corrective distributions of Excess Elective Deferrals, or Excess Annual Additions, will consist of a Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals, Roth Elective Deferrals, or a combination of both, to the extent such type of Elective Deferral was made for the year. The operational procedures may include an option for Participants to designate whether the distribution is being made from Pre-Tax or Roth Elective Deferrals.3. Distribution Request: When Distributed—A Participant or Beneﬁ ciary entitled to a distribution who wishes to receive a distribution must submit a request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator. If required in writing, such request will be made upon a form provided or approved by the Plan Administrator. Upon a valid request, the Plan Administrator will direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to commence distribution as soon as administratively feasible after the request is received. Distributions will be made based on the value of the Individual Account available at the time of actual distribution. To the extent the distribution request is for an amount greater than the Individual Account, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be entitled to distribute the entire Individual Account.B. Distributions Upon Termination of Employment1. Individual Account Balances Less Than or Equal to Cashout Level—If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account does not exceed the cashout level, the following rules will apply. If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account does not qualify as an Eligible Rollover Distribution, distribution from the Plan may be made to the Participant in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribu-tion under the Plan. If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account does not exceed $1,000 and qualiﬁ es as an Eligible Rollover Distribution, and the Participant does not elect to have such distribu-tion paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan speciﬁ ed by the Participant in a Direct Rollover or to receive the distribution in accor-dance with this Section Five of the Plan, distribution will be made to the Participant in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribution under the Plan. If the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $1,000 and qualiﬁ es as an Eligible Rollover Distribution, and if the Participant does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan speciﬁ ed by the Participant in a Direct Rollover or to receive the distribution in accordance with this Section Five of the Plan, distribu-tion will be paid by the Plan Administrator in a Direct Rollover to an individual retirement arrangement (as described in Code section 408(a), 408(b) or 408A) designated by the Plan Administrator.  Distributions made under this paragraph will occur following the Participant’s Termination of Employment in accordance with a uni-form and nondiscriminatory schedule established by the Plan Administrator. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Participant is reemployed by the Employer before the occurrence of the distribu-tion, no distribution will be made under this paragraph. The value of the Participant’s Individual Account for purposes of this paragraph will be determined by including rollover contributions (and earnings allocable thereto) within the meaning of Code sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3)(a)(ii), and 457(e)(16). 2. Individual Account Balances Exceeding Cashout Level—If distribution in the form of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is required with respect to a Participant and either the value of the Participant’s Vested Individual Account exceeds the cashout level or there are remaining payments to be made with respect to a particular distribu-tion option that previously commenced, and if the Individual Account is immediately distributable, the Participant must consent to any distribution of such Individual Account. If distribution in the form of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is not required with respect to a Participant and the value of such Participant’s Vested Individual Account exceeds the cashout level, and if the Individual Account is immediately distributable, the Participant must consent to any distribution of such Individual Account. The consent of the Participant and the Participant’s Spouse will be obtained (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) within the 180-day period ending on the Annuity Starting Date. The Plan Administrator shall notify the Participant and the Participant’s Spouse of the right to defer any distribution until the Participant’s Individual Account is no longer immediately distributable and, for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2006, the consequences of failing to defer any distri-bution. Such notiﬁ cation will include a general description of the material features, and an explanation of the relative values of the optional forms of beneﬁ t available under the Plan in a manner that would satisfy the notice requirements of Code section 417(a)(3), and a description of the consequences of failing to defer a distribution, and will be provided no less than 30 days and no more than 180 days before the Annuity Starting Date. If a distribution is one to which Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417 do not apply, such distribution may commence less than 30 days after the notice required in Treasury Regulation section 1.411(a)-11(c) is given, provided that:a. the Plan Administrator clearly informs the Participant that the Participant has a right to a period of at least 30 days after receiving the notice to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular distribution option), andb. the Participant, after receiving the notice, afﬁ rmatively elects a distribution. Notwithstanding the preceding, only the Participant need consent to the commencement of a distribution that is either made in the form of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or is made from a Plan that meets the Retirement Equity Act safe harbor rules of Plan Section 5.10(E), while the Individual Account is immediately distributable. Neither the consent of the Participant nor the Participant’s Spouse will be required to the extent that a distribution is required to satisfy Code section 401(a)(9) or Code section 415. In addition, upon termi-nation of this Plan, if the Plan does not offer an annuity option (purchased from a commercial provider), the Participant’s Individual Account may, without the Participant’s consent, be distributed to the Participant or transferred to another deﬁ ned contribution plan (other than an employee stock ownership plan as deﬁ ned in Code section 4975(e)(7)) within the same controlled group. An Individual Account is immediately distributable if any part of the Individual Account could be distributed to the Participant (or surviv-ing Spouse) before the Participant attains or would have attained (if not deceased) the later of Normal Retirement Age or age 62.3. Distribution Before Attainment of Normal Retirement Age—A Participant who has incurred a Termination of Employment before attaining Normal Retirement Age may elect to receive a distribution \fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1216-17 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

A Participant who has incurred a Severance from Employment before attaining Normal Retirement Age may elect to receive a distribution with regard to Elective Deferrals.C. Distributions During Employment1. In-Service Distributions—A Participant may elect to receive an in-service distribution of all or part of their Individual Account attribut-able to Employer Contributions, other than those described in Plan Sections 5.01(A)(2), upon meeting one of the following requirements. a. Participant for Five or More Years—An Employee who has been a Participant in the Plan for ﬁ ve or more years may withdraw up to the entire Individual Account.b. Participant for Less than Five Years—An Employee who has been a Participant in the Plan for less than ﬁ ve years may withdraw only the amount that has been in their Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions for at least two full Plan Years, measured from the date such contributions were allocated.  A Participant who is not otherwise eligible to receive a distribution of their Individual Account may elect to receive an in-service distribution of all or part of the Vested portion of their Individual Account attribut-able to transfers of money purchase pension contributions at age 62.  All in-service distributions are subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10, as applicable.2. Hardship Withdrawals a. Hardship Withdrawals of Employer Proﬁ t Sharing Contributions—Notwithstanding Plan Section 5.01(C)(1), an Employee may elect to receive a hardship distribution of all or part of the Vested portion of their Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions other than those described in Plan Section 5.01(A)(2), subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10.  For purposes of this Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(a), hardship is deﬁ ned as an immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need of the Employee where such Employee lacks other available resources. Financial needs considered immediate and heavy include, but are not limited to, 1) expenses incurred or necessary for medical care, described in Code section 213(d), of the Employee, the Employee’s Spouse, depen-dents, or the Employee’s Primary Beneﬁ ciary, 2) the purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence for the Employee, 3) payment of tuition and related educational fees for the next 12 months of post-secondary education for the Employee, the Employee’s spouse, children, dependents, or the Employee’s Primary Beneﬁ ciary, 4) payment to prevent the eviction of the Employee from, or a foreclosure on the mortgage of, the Employee’s principal residence, 5), funeral or burial expenses for the Employee’s deceased parent, Spouse, child, dependent, or the Employee’s Primary Beneﬁ ciary, and 6) payment to repair damage to the Employee’s principal residence that would qualify for a casualty loss deduction under Code section 165 (determined without regard to whether the loss exceeds ten-percent of adjusted gross income). A distribution will be considered necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need of the Employee only ifi. the Employee has obtained all distributions, other than hardship distributions, and all nontaxable loans available under all plans maintained by the Employer; andii. the distribution is not in excess of the amount of an immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need (including amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution).b. Hardship Withdrawals of Elective Deferrals—Distribution of Elective Deferrals (including and any earnings credited to an Employee’s account as of the later of December 31, 1988, and the end of the last Plan Year ending before July 1, 1989) may be made to an Employee in the event of hardship. For the purposes of this Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(b), hardship is deﬁ ned as an immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need of the Employee where the distribution is needed to satisfy the immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need of such Employee. Hardship distributions are subject to the spousal consent require-ments contained in Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417, if applicable. For purposes of determining whether an Employee has a hardship, rules similar to those described in Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(a) will apply except that only the ﬁ nancial needs listed above will be considered. In addition, a distribution will be considered as necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need of the Employee only ifi. all plans maintained by the Employer provide that the Employee’s Elective Deferrals will be suspended for six months (12 months for hardship distributions before 2002) after the receipt of the hardship distribution; andii. for hardship distributions before 2002, all plans maintained by the Employer provide that the Employee may not make Elective Deferrals for the Employee’s taxable year immediately following the taxable year of the hardship distribution in excess of the applicable limit under Code section 402(g) for such taxable year less the amount of such Employee’s Elective Deferrals for the taxable year of the hardship distribution.3. Qualiﬁ ed Reservist Distributions—Participants may take penalty-free qualiﬁ ed reservist distributions from the Plan. A qualiﬁ ed reservist distribution means any distribution to a Participant where 1) such distribution is made from Elective Deferrals, 2) such Participant was ordered or called to active duty for a period in excess of 179 days or for an indeﬁ nite period, and 3) such distribution is made during the period beginning on the date of such order or call and ending at the close of the active duty period. The Participant must have been ordered or called to active duty after September 11, 2001.D. Miscellaneous Distribution Issues 1. Distribution of Rollover and Transfer Contributions—The following rules will apply with respect to entitlement to distribution of rollover and transfer contributions. a. Entitlement to Distribution—Rollover contributions (including rollovers of nondeductible employee contributions) and earnings thereon may be distributed at any time upon request. Transfer contributions may be distributed at any time upon request.  To the extent that any optional form of beneﬁ t under this Plan permits a distribution before the Employee’s retirement, death, Disability, attainment of Normal Retirement Age, or Termination of Employment, or before Plan termination, the optional form of ben-eﬁ t is not available with respect to beneﬁ ts attributable to assets (including the post-transfer earnings thereon) and liabilities that are transferred (within the meaning of Code section 414(l)) to this Plan from a money purchase pension plan or a target beneﬁ t pension plan qualiﬁ ed under Code section 401(a) (other than any portion of those assets and liabilities attributable to voluntary employee contributions). In addition, if such transfers consist of Elective Deferrals (including earnings thereon) from a 401(k) plan, the assets transferred will continue to be subject to the distribution restrictions under Code sections 401(k)(2) and 401(k)(10). b. Direct Rollovers of Eligible Rollover Distributions –A Recipient may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution that is equal to at least $500 (or such lesser amount if the Plan Administrator permits in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner) paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan speciﬁ ed by the Recipient in a Direct Rollover. 2. Commencement of Beneﬁ ts—Notwithstanding any other provision, unless the Participant elects otherwise, distribution of beneﬁ ts will begin no later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the Plan Year in whicha. the Participant attains age 65 (or Normal Retirement Age, if earlier),Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1218-19 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Notwithstanding the preceding, the failure of a Participant (and Spouse, if applicable) to consent to a distribution while a beneﬁ t is immediately distributable, within the meaning of Plan Section 5.01(B)(2), will be deemed to be an election to defer commencement of pay-ment of any beneﬁ t sufﬁ cient to satisfy this Plan Section 5.01(D)(2). 3. Federally Declared Disaster—If allowed by the Plan Sponsor, Participants may have previously requested or may in the future request a distribution of, or a loan from, the Vested portion of their Individual Account balance related to federally declared disaster area tax relief (e.g., Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005, Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008), as speciﬁ ed by the Plan Sponsor and as allowed under the Code and any additional rules, regulations, or other pronouncements promulgated by either the IRS or DOL.5.02 Form of Distribution to a Participant If the value of the Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $1,000 and the Participant has properly waived the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity (if applicable), as described in Plan Section 5.10, the Participant may request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) that the Individual Account be paid to them in one or more of the following forms of payment: 1) in a lump sum, 2) in a non-recurring partial payment, 3) in installment payments (a series of regularly scheduled recurring partial payments), or 4) applied to the purchase of an annuity contract. Notwithstanding the preceding, non-recurring partial payments may be made from the Plan either before Termination of Employment or to satisfy the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9).5.03 Distributions Upon the Death of a ParticipantA. Designation of Beneﬁ ciary—Spousal Consent—Each Participant may designate, in a form or manner approved by and delivered to the Plan Administrator, one or more primary and contingent Beneﬁ ciaries to receive all or a speciﬁ ed portion of the Participant’s Individual Account in the event of the Participant’s death. A Participant may change or revoke such Beneﬁ ciary designation by completing and delivering the proper form to the Plan Administrator. In the event that a Participant wishes to designate a Primary Beneﬁ ciary who is not their Spouse, their Spouse must consent (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to such designation, and the Spouse’s consent must acknowledge the effect of such designation and be witnessed by a notary public or plan representative. Notwithstanding this consent requirement, if the Participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Plan Administrator that such consent may not be obtained because there is no Spouse or the Spouse cannot be located, no consent will be required. In addition, if the Spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, the Spouse’s legal guardian, even if the guardian is the Participant, may give consent. If the Participant is legally separated or the Participant has been aban-doned (within the meaning of local law) and the Participant has a court order to such effect, spousal consent is not required unless a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order provides otherwise. Any change of Beneﬁ ciary will require a new spousal consent to the extent required by the Code or Treasury Regulations. B. Payment to Beneﬁ ciary—If a Participant dies before the Participant’s entire Individual Account has been paid to them, such deceased Participant’s Individual Account will be payable to any surviving Beneﬁ ciary designated by the Participant, or, if no Beneﬁ ciary survives the Participant, to the Participant’s Spouse, or, where no Spouse exists, to the Participant’s estate. If the Beneﬁ ciary is a minor, distribution will be deemed to have been made to such Beneﬁ ciary if the portion of the Participant’s Individual Account to which the Beneﬁ ciary is entitled is paid to their legal guardian or, if applicable, to their custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. If a Beneﬁ ciary is not a minor but is not legally competent to request or consent to a distribution, distributions will be deemed to have been made to such Beneﬁ ciary if the portion of the Participant’s Individual Account to which the Beneﬁ ciary is entitled is paid to the Participant’s court-appointed guardian, an attorney-in-fact acting under a valid power of attorney, or any other individual or entity authorized under state law to act on behalf of the Beneﬁ ciary. A Beneﬁ ciary may disclaim their portion of a Participant’s Individual Account by providing the Plan Administrator written notiﬁ cation pursuant to Code section 2518(b). C. Distribution Request—When Distributed—A Beneﬁ ciary of a deceased Participant entitled to a distribution who wishes to receive a distribution must submit a request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator. If required in writing, such request will be made on a form provided or approved by the Plan Administrator. Upon a valid request, the Plan Administrator shall direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to commence distribution as soon as administratively fea-sible after the request is received. 5.04 Form of Distribution to Beneﬁ ciariesA. Value of Individual Account Does Not Exceed $5,000—If the value of the a Participant’s Individual Account does not exceed $5,000, the value of a Participant’s Individual Account may be made to the Beneﬁ ciary in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribution under the Plan, as soon as administratively feasible.The value of the Participant’s Individual Account for purposes of this paragraph will be determined by including rollover contributions (and earnings allocable thereto) within the meaning of Code sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3)(A)(ii), and 457(e)(16).B. Value of Individual Account Exceeds $5,000—If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $5,000, the preretirement survivor annuity requirements of Plan Section 5.10 will apply unless waived in accordance with that Plan Section 5.10 or unless the Retirement Equity Act safe harbor rules of Plan Section 5.10(E) apply. However, a surviving Spouse Beneﬁ ciary may elect any form of payment allowable under the Plan in lieu of the preretirement survivor annuity. Any such payment to the surviving Spouse must meet the requirements of Plan Section 5.05.If the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $5,000 and either (1) the preretirement survivor annuity requirements of Plan Section 5.10 have been satisﬁ ed or waived in accordance or (2) the Retirement Equity Act safe harbor rules of Plan Section 5.10(E) apply, the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account may be made to the Beneﬁ ciary in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribution under the Plan, as soon as administratively feasible.C. Other Forms of Distribution to Beneﬁ ciary—If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $5,000 and the Participant has properly waived the preretirement survivor annuity, as described in Plan Section 5.10 (if applicable), or if the Beneﬁ ciary is the Participant’s sur-viving Spouse, the Beneﬁ ciary may, subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.05, request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) that the Participant’s Individual Account be paid in any form of distribution permitted to be taken by the Participant under this Plan other than applying the Individual Account toward the purchase of an annuity contract. Notwithstanding the preceding, installment payments to a Beneﬁ ciary cannot be made over a period exceeding the Life Expectancy of such Beneﬁ ciary.Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, a Beneﬁ ciary is permitted (subject to regulatory guidance) to directly roll over their portion of the Individual Account to an inherited individual retirement arrangement (under Code sections 408 or 408A). Such Direct Rollovers must other-wise qualify as Eligible Rollover Distributions. 5.05 Required Minimum Distribution Requirements A. General Rules1. Subject to Plan Section 5.10, the requirements of this Plan Section 5.05 will apply to any distribution of a Participant’s interest and will \fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1218-19 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Unless otherwise speciﬁ ed, the provisions of this Plan Section 5.05 apply to calendar years beginning after December 31, 2002.2. All distributions required under this Plan Section 5.05 will be deter-mined and made in accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9), including the minimum distribution incidental beneﬁ t requirement of Code section 401(a)(9)(G). 3. Limits on Distribution Periods—As of the ﬁ rst Distribution Calendar Year, distributions to a Participant, if not made in a single sum, may only be made over one of the following periods (or a combina-tion thereof): a. the life of the Participant,b. the joint lives of the Participant and a Designated Beneﬁ ciary,c. a period certain not extending beyond the Life Expectancy of the Participant, ord. a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and a Designated Beneﬁ ciary. B. Time and Manner of Distribution1. Required Beginning Date—The Participant’s entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant’s Required Beginning Date. For purposes of this Plan Section 5.05(B) and Plan Section 5.05(D), unless Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(iii) applies, distributions are consid-ered to begin on the Participant’s Required Beginning Date. If Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(iii) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(i). If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably com-mence to the Participant before the Participant’s Required Beginning Date (or to the Participant’s surviving Spouse before the date distri-butions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse in Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(i)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. Except as provided in a separate IRS model amendment, if appli-cable, Participants or Beneﬁ ciaries may elect on an individual basis whether the ﬁ ve-year rule or the life expectancy rule in Plan Section 5.05(D) applies to distributions after the death of a Participant who has a Designated Beneﬁ ciary. The election must be made no later than the earlier of September 30 of the calendar year in which distri-bution would be required to begin under this Plan Section 5.05(B), or by September 30 of the calendar year that contains the ﬁ fth anniver-sary of the Participant’s (or, if applicable, surviving Spouse’s) death. If neither the Participant nor the Beneﬁ ciary makes an election under this paragraph, distributions will be made in accordance with this Plan Section 5.05(B) and Plan Section 5.05(D) and, if applicable, the election in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable).2. Forms of Distribution—Unless the Participant’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the ﬁ rst Distribution Calendar Year distributions will be made in accor-dance with Plan Section 5.05(C) and Plan Section 5.05(D). If the Participant’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity pur-chased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding Treasury Regulations.C. Required Minimum Distributions During Participant’s Lifetime1. Amount of Required Minimum Distribution for Each Distribution Calendar Year—During the Participant’s lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year is the lesser of:a. the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s Beneﬁ t by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-9, Q&A 2, using the Participant’s age as of the Participant’s birthday in the Distribution Calendar Year; orb. if the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary for the Distribution Calendar Year is the Participant’s Spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s Beneﬁ t by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-9, Q&A 3, using the Participant’s and Spouse’s attained ages as of the Participant’s and Spouse’s birthdays in the Distribution Calendar Year. 2. Lifetime Required Minimum Distributions Continue Through Year of Participant’s Death—Required minimum distributions will be deter-mined under this Plan Section 5.05(C) beginning with the ﬁ rst Distribution Calendar Year and up to and including the Distribution Calendar Year that includes the Participant’s date of death.D. Required Minimum Distributions After Participant’s Death1. Death On or After Date Distributions Begina. Participant Survived by Designated Beneﬁ ciary—If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneﬁ ciary, the minimum amount that will be distrib-uted for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s beneﬁ t by the longer of the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant or the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant’s Designated Beneﬁ ciary, determined as follows:i. The Participant’s remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.ii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving Spouse is calculated for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death using the surviving Spouse’s age as of the Spouse’s birthday in that year. For Distribution Calendar Years after the year of the surviving Spouse’s death, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving Spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving Spouse as of the Spouse’s birthday in the calendar year of the Spouse’s death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year.iii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is not the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary, the Designated Beneﬁ ciary’s remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Designated Beneﬁ ciary in the year following the year of the Participant’s death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.b. No Designated Beneﬁ ciary—If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneﬁ ciary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant’s death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s beneﬁ t by the Participant’s remaining Life Expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.2. Death Before Date Distributions Begina. Participant Survived by Designated Beneﬁ ciary—Except as provided in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable, or as elected by a Designated Beneﬁ ciary pursuant to Plan Section 5.05(B)(1), if the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneﬁ ciary, the minimum amount that will be distrib-uted for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s beneﬁ t by the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant’s Designated Beneﬁ ciary, determined as provided in Plan Section 5.05(D)(1).Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1220-21 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary, then, (except as provided in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable), distributions to the surviv-ing Spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70½, if later.ii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is not the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary, then, (except as provided in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable), distributions to the Designated Beneﬁ ciary will begin by December 31 of the calen-dar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died. iii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary and the surviving Spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving Spouse are required to begin, this Plan Section 5.05(D)(2), other than Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a), will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant.b. No Designated Beneﬁ ciary—If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneﬁ ciary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant’s death, distribution of the Participant’s entire interest will be com-pleted by December 31 of the calendar year containing the ﬁ fth anniversary of the Participant’s death.3. Election to Allow Designated Beneﬁ ciary Receiving Distributions Under Five-Year Rule to Elect Life Expectancy Distributions—Unless speciﬁ ed otherwise in a separate IRS model amendment, a Designated Beneﬁ ciary who is receiving payments under the ﬁ ve-year rule may have made a new election to receive payments under the life expectancy rule until December 31, 2003, provided that all amounts that would have been required to be distributed under the life expectancy rule for all distribution calendar years before 2004 are distributed by the earlier of December 31, 2003 or the end of the ﬁ ve-year period.E. TEFRA Section 242(b) Elections1. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Plan Section 5.05 and subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10, Joint and Survivor Annuity Requirements, distribution on behalf of any Employee (or former Employee), including a ﬁ ve-percent owner, who has made a designation under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 Section 242(b)(2) (a “Section 242(b)(2) Election”) may be made in accordance with all of the following requirements (regardless of when such distribution commences).a. The distribution by the Fund is one which would not have qualiﬁ ed such Fund under Code section 401(a)(9) as in effect before amend-ment by the Deﬁ cit Reduction Act of 1984.b. The distribution is in accordance with a method of distribution designated by the Employee whose interest in the Fund is being distributed or, if the Employee is deceased, by a Beneﬁ ciary of such Employee.c. Such designation was in writing, was signed by the Employee or the Beneﬁ ciary, and was made before January 1, 1984.d. The Employee had accrued a beneﬁ t under the Plan as of December 31, 1983.e. The method of distribution designated by the Employee or the Beneﬁ ciary speciﬁ es the time at which distribution will commence, the period over which distributions will be made, and in the case of any distribution upon the Employee’s death, the Beneﬁ ciaries of the Employee listed in order of priority.2. A distribution upon death will not be covered by this transitional rule unless the information in the designation contains the required information described above with respect to the distributions to be made upon the death of the Employee.3. If a designation is revoked, any subsequent distribution must satisfy the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding regulations. If a designation is revoked subsequent to the date distributions are required to begin, the Plan must distribute, by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the revocation occurs, the total amount not yet distributed which would have been required to have been distributed to satisfy Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding regulations, but for an election made under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Section 242(b)(2). For calendar years beginning after December 31, 1988, such distributions must meet the minimum distribution inci-dental beneﬁ t requirements. Any changes in the designation will be considered to be a revocation of the designation. However, the mere substitution or addition of another Beneﬁ ciary (one not named in the designation) under the designation will not be considered to be a revocation of the designation, provided such substitution or addition does not alter the period over which distributions are to be made under the designation, directly or indirectly (for example, by altering the relevant measuring life). 4. In the case in which an amount is transferred or rolled over from one plan to another plan, the rules in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-8, Q&A 14 and Q&A 15, will apply.F. Transition Rules—For plans in existence before 2003, required minimum distributions before 2003 were made pursuant to Plan Section 5.05(E), if applicable, and Plan Sections 5.05(F)(1) through 5.05(F)(3) below.1. 2000 and Before—Required minimum distributions for calendar years after 1984 and before 2001 were made in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding Proposed Treasury Regulations published in the Federal Register on July 27, 1987 (the “1987 Proposed Regulations”).2. 2001—Required minimum distributions for calendar year 2001 were made in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the Proposed Treasury Regulations in Section 401(a)(9) as published in the Federal Register on January 17, 2001 (the “2001 Proposed Regulations”) unless a prior IRS model amendment provision was adopted that stated that the required minimum distributions for 2001 were made pursuant to the 1987 Proposed Regulations. If distributions were made in 2001 under the 1987 Proposed Regulations before the date in 2001 that the Plan began operating under the 2001 Proposed Regulations, the special transition rule in Announcement 2001-82, 2001-2 C.B. 123, applied.3. 2002—Required minimum distributions for calendar year 2002 were made in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the 2001 Proposed Regulations unless the prior IRS model amendment, if applicable, provided that either a. or b. below applies.a. Required minimum distributions for 2002 were made pursuant to the 1987 Proposed Regulations.b. Required minimum distributions for 2002 were made pursuant to the Final and Temporary Treasury Regulations under Code section 401(a)(9) published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2002 (the “2002 Final and Temporary Regulations”), which are described in Plan Sections 5.05(B) through 5.05(E). If distributions were made in 2002 under either the 1987 Proposed Regulations or the 2001 Proposed Regulations before the date in 2002 on which the Plan began operating under the 2002 Final and Temporary Regulations, the special transition rule in Section 1.2 of the model amendment in Revenue Procedure 2002-29, 2002-1 C.B. 1176, applied.G. Temporary Waiver of Required Minimum Distribution Requirements—Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or the deﬁ nition of Distribution Calendar Year to the contrary, Participants and Beneﬁ ciaries who would have been required to receive a 2009 RMD or Extended 2009 RMD but for the enactment of Code section 401(a)(9)(H) were given the choice to receive such distributions for 2009. If a Participant or Beneﬁ ciary described above was allowed to remove their 2009 RMD or Extended 2009 RMD but did not elect to receive such amount, the 2009 RMD or Extended 2009 RMD was retained in the Plan. \fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1220-21 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The terms of any annuity contract purchased and distributed by the Plan to a Participant or Spouse will comply with the requirements of the Plan.5.07 Distributions In-KindThe Plan Administrator may, but need not, cause any distribution under this Plan to be made either in a form actually held in the Fund, or in cash by converting assets other than cash into cash, or in any combina-tion of the two preceding methods. Assets other than cash, or other assets with a readily ascertainable market value, must be subject to a third-party appraisal before they may be distributed from the Plan.5.08 Procedure for Missing Participants or Beneﬁ ciariesThe Plan Administrator must use all reasonable measures to locate Participants or Beneﬁ ciaries who are entitled to distributions from the Plan. Such measures may include using certiﬁ ed mail, checking records of other plans maintained by the Employer, contacting the Participant’s Beneﬁ ciaries, using a governmental letter-forwarding service, or using internet search tools, commercial locator services, and credit reporting agencies. The Plan Administrator should consider the cost of the mea-sures relative to the Individual Account balance when determining which measures are used.In the event that the Plan Administrator cannot locate a Participant or Beneﬁ ciary who is entitled to a distribution from the Plan after using all reasonable measures, the Plan Administrator may, consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and other pronouncements under the Code and ERISA, use any reasonable procedure to dispose of distributable Plan assets, including any of the following: 1) establish an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), under Code section 408, that complies with the automatic rollover safe harbor regulations, without regard to the amount in the Individual Account, 2) establish a federally insured bank account for and in the name of the Participant or Beneﬁ ciary and transfer the assets to such bank account, 3) purchase an annuity con-tract with the assets in the name of the Participant or Beneﬁ ciary (unless an annuity form of distribution is prohibited under the Plan), or 4) transfer the assets to the unclaimed property fund of the state in which the Participant or Beneﬁ ciary was last known to reside. In the event the Plan is terminated, payments must be made in a man-ner that protects the beneﬁ t rights of a Participant or Beneﬁ ciary. Beneﬁ t rights will be deemed to be protected if the amount in a Participant’s or Beneﬁ ciary’s Individual Account is placed into an IRA, used to purchase an annuity contract, or transferred to another quali-ﬁ ed retirement plan. Beneﬁ t rights need not, however, be protected if an Individual Account becomes subject to state escheat laws, or if a pay-ment is made to satisfy Code section 401(a)(9), or if such other pro-cess is followed that is consistent with applicable statutory or regulatory guidance.5.09 Claims ProceduresA. Filing a Claim for Plan Distributions—A Participant or Beneﬁ ciary who has been denied a request for a distribution or loan and desires to make a claim for the Participant’s Individual Account will ﬁ le a request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL and acceptable to the Plan Administrator) with the Plan Administrator. If such request is required in writing, such request must be made on a form furnished to them by the Plan Administrator for such purpose. The request will set forth the basis of the claim. The Plan Administrator is authorized to conduct such examinations as may be necessary to facilitate the payment of any beneﬁ ts to which the Participant or Beneﬁ ciary may be entitled under the terms of the Plan. B. Denial of a Claim—Whenever a claim for a Plan distribution or loan submitted in accordance with this Plan Section 5.09 by any Participant or Beneﬁ ciary has been wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator must furnish such Participant or Beneﬁ ciary notice (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) of the denial within 90 days (45 days for claims involving disability beneﬁ ts) of the date the original claim was ﬁ led. This notice will set forth the speciﬁ c reasons for the denial, speciﬁ c reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based, a description of any addi-tional information or material needed to perfect the claim, an explana-tion of why such additional information or material is necessary, and an explanation of the procedures for appeal. C. Remedies Available—The Participant or Beneﬁ ciary will have 60 days from receipt of the denial notice in which to make written application for review by the Plan Administrator. The Participant or Beneﬁ ciary may request that the review be in the nature of a hearing. The Participant or Beneﬁ ciary will have the right to representation, to review pertinent documents, and to submit comments in writing (or in any other form permitted by the IRS or DOL). The Plan Administrator shall issue a decision on such review within 60 days (45 days for claims involving disability beneﬁ ts) after receipt of an application for review as provided for in this Plan Section 5.09. Upon a decision unfavorable to the Participant or Beneﬁ ciary, such Participant or Beneﬁ ciary will be entitled to bring such actions in law or equity as may be necessary or appropri-ate to protect or clarify their right to beneﬁ ts under this Plan.5.10 Joint and Survivor Annuity RequirementsA. Application—The provisions of this Plan Section 5.10 will apply to any Participant who is credited with at least one Hour of Service with the Employer on or after August 23, 1984, and such other Participants as provided in Treasury Regulations.B. Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity—Unless an optional form of beneﬁ t is selected pursuant to a Qualiﬁ ed Election within the 180-day period ending on the Annuity Starting Date, a married Participant’s Individual Account Balance will be paid in the form of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity and an unmarried Participant’s account balance will be paid in the form of a life annuity. The Participant may elect to have such annuity distributed upon attainment of the Earliest Retirement Age under the Plan. In the case of a married Participant, the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity must be at least as valuable as any other optional form of beneﬁ t payable under the Plan at the same time.A Plan that is subject to the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity require-ments must offer an additional survivor annuity option in the form of a Qualiﬁ ed Optional Survivor Annuity. C. Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity—Unless an optional form of beneﬁ t has been selected within the Election Period pursuant to a Qualiﬁ ed Election, if a Participant dies before the Annuity Starting Date then the Participant’s Individual Account shall be applied toward the purchase of an annuity for the life of the surviving Spouse. The surviv-ing Spouse may elect to have such annuity distributed within a reason-able period after the Participant’s death.D. Notice Requirements1. In the case of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity, the Plan Administrator shall no less than 30 days and not more than 180 days before the Annuity Starting Date provide each Participant an explanation (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) of 1) the terms and condi-tions of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity, 2) the Participant’s right to make and the effect of an election to waive the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity form of beneﬁ t, 3) the rights of a Participant’s Spouse, and 4) the right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of a previous election to waive the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity. The written explanation shall comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.417(a)(3)-1. The Annuity Starting Date for a distribution in a form other than a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity may be less than 30 days after receipt of the explanation described in the preceding paragraph Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1222-23 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

In the case of a Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity as described in Plan Section 5.10(C), the Plan Administrator shall provide each Participant within the applicable period for such Participant an expla-nation (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) of the Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity in such terms and in such manner as would be comparable to the explanation provided for meeting the requirements of Plan Section 5.10(D)(1) applicable to a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity. The written explanation shall comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.417(a)(3)-1. The applicable period for a Participant is whichever of the following periods ends last: 1) the period beginning with the ﬁ rst day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 32 and ending with the close of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 35, 2) a reasonable period ending after the individual becomes a Participant, 3) a reasonable period ending after Plan Section 5.10(D)(3) ceases to apply to the Participant, and 4) a reasonable period ending after this Plan Section 5.10 ﬁ rst applies to the Participant. Notwithstanding the preceding, notice must be provided within a reasonable period ending after separation from service in the case of a Participant who separates from service before attaining age 35. For purposes of applying the preceding paragraph, a reasonable period ending after the enumerated events described in 2), 3) and 4) is the end of the two-year period beginning one year before the date the applicable event occurs, and ending one year after that date. In the case of a Participant who separates from service before the Plan Year in which age 35 is attained, notice will be provided within the two-year period beginning one year before separation and ending one year after separation. If such a Participant thereafter returns to employment with the Employer, the applicable period for such Participant will be redetermined.3. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Plan Section 5.10(D), the respective notices prescribed by this Plan Section 5.10(D) need not be given to a Participant if 1) the Plan “fully subsidizes” the costs of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity, and 2) the Plan does not allow the Participant to waive the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity and does not allow a married Participant to designate a non-Spouse Beneﬁ ciary. For purposes of this Plan Section 5.10(D)(3), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a beneﬁ t if no increase in cost or decrease in beneﬁ ts to the Participant may result from the Participant’s failure to elect another beneﬁ t.E. Retirement Equity Act Safe Harbor Rules1. The safe harbor provisions of this Plan Section 5.10(E) shall always apply to any distribution made on or after the ﬁ rst day of the ﬁ rst Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1988, from or under a separate account attributable solely to accumulated deductible employee contributions, as deﬁ ned in Code section 72(o)(5)(B), and maintained on behalf of a Participant in a money purchase pension plan, if the following conditions are satisﬁ ed:a. the Participant does not or cannot elect payments in the form of a life annuity; andb. on the death of a Participant, the Participant’s account balance will be paid to the Participant’s surviving Spouse, but if there is no surviving Spouse, or if the surviving Spouse has consented in a manner conforming to a Qualiﬁ ed Election, then to the Participant’s Designated Beneﬁ ciary. The surviving Spouse may elect to have distribution of the account balance commence within the 180-day period following the date of the Participant’s death. The account balance shall be adjusted for gains or losses occurring after the Participant’s death in accordance with the provisions of the Plan governing the adjustment of account balances for other types of distributions. This Plan Section 5.10(E) will not apply to a Participant in a proﬁ t sharing plan if the plan is a direct or indirect transferee of a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan, money purchase pension plan, a target beneﬁ t pension plan, stock bonus, or proﬁ t sharing plan that is subject to the survivor annuity requirements of Code sec-tions 401(a)(11) and 417. If this Plan Section 5.10(E) applies, then no other provisions of this Plan Section 5.10 will apply except as provided in Treasury Regulations.2. The Participant may waive the spousal death beneﬁ t described in this Plan Section 5.10(E) at any time provided that no such waiver will be effective unless it is a Qualiﬁ ed Election (other than the notiﬁ cation requirement referred to therein) that would apply to the Participant’s waiver of the Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity.3. In the event this Plan is a direct or indirect transferee of or a restatement of a plan previously subject to the survivor annuity requirements of Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417 and the Employer has selected to have this Plan Section 5.10(E) apply, the provisions of this Plan Section 5.10(E) will not apply to any beneﬁ ts accrued (including subsequent adjustments for earnings and losses) before the adoption of these provisions. Such amounts will be separately accounted for in a manner consistent with Plan Section 7.02 and administered in accordance with the general survivor annuity require-ments of Plan Section 5.10. 5.11 Liability for Withholding on DistributionsThe Plan Administrator shall be responsible for withholding federal income taxes from distributions from the Plan, unless the Participant (or Beneﬁ ciary, where applicable) elects not to have such taxes withheld. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or other payor may act as agent for the Plan Administrator to withhold such taxes and to make the appropri-ate distribution reports, provided the Plan Administrator furnishes all the information to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or other payor which such payor may need to properly perform withholding and reporting. 5.12 Distribution of Excess Elective DeferralsA. General Rule—A Participant may assign to this Plan any Excess Elective Deferrals made during a taxable year of the Participant by notifying the Plan Administrator of the amount of the Excess Elective Deferrals to be assigned to the Plan. Participants who claim Excess Elective Deferrals for the preceding calendar year must submit their claims (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator by March 1. A Participant is deemed to notify the Plan Administrator of any Excess Elective Deferrals that arise by taking into account only those Elective Deferrals made to this Plan and any other plan, contract, or arrange-ment of the Employer.Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, Excess Elective Deferrals, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto, will be distributed no later than April 15th to any Participant to whose Individual Account Excess Elective Deferrals were assigned for the preceding year and who claims Excess Elective Deferrals for such tax-able year, except to the extent such Excess Elective Deferrals were classiﬁ ed as Catch-up Contributions. For years beginning after 2005, the Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, will determine whether the distribution of Excess Elective Deferrals for a year will be made ﬁ rst from the Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferral account or the Roth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, to the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify otherwise.B. Determination of Income or Loss—For taxable years beginning after 2007, Excess Elective Deferrals will be adjusted for any income or loss \fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1222-23 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals is the income or loss allocable to the Participant’s Elective Deferral account for the taxable year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is such Participant’s Excess Elective Deferrals for the year and the denom-inator of which is the Participant’s Individual Account balance attribut-able to Elective Deferrals without regard to any income or loss occurring during such taxable year. For taxable years beginning before 2008, income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals also included ten percent of the amount determined under the preceding sentence multi-plied by the number of whole calendar months between the end of the Participant’s taxable year and the date of distribution, counting the month of distribution if distribution occurs after the 15th of such month. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Plan Administrator may compute the income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B) (i.e., the usual manner used by the Plan for allocating income or loss to Participants’ Individual Accounts or any reasonable method), provided such method is used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year. The Plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the income or loss on Excess Elective Deferrals merely because the income allocable is based on a date that is no more than seven days before the distribution.5.13 Distribution of Excess ContributionsA. General Rule—Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, Excess Contributions, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto, will be distributed no later than 12 months after a Plan Year to Participants to whose Individual Accounts such Excess Contributions were allocated for such Plan Year, except to the extent such Excess Contributions were classiﬁ ed as Catch-up Contributions. Excess Contributions are allocated to the Highly Compensated Employees with the largest amounts of Employer Contributions taken into account in calculating the ADP test for the year in which the excess arose, begin-ning with the Highly Compensated Employee with the largest amount of such Employer Contributions and continuing in descending order until all the Excess Contributions have been allocated. Both the total amount of the Excess Contribution and, for purposes of the preceding sentence, the “largest amount” are determined after distribution of any Excess Deferrals. To the extent a Highly Compensated Employee has not reached their Catch-up Contribution limit under the Plan, Excess Contributions allocated to such Highly Compensated Employees as Catch-up Contributions will not be treated as Excess Contributions. If such Excess Contributions are distributed more than 2½ months after the last day of the Plan Year in which such Contributions were made, a ten-percent excise tax will be imposed on the Employer maintaining the Plan with respect to such amounts. Excess Contributions will be treated as annual additions under the Plan even if distributed.B. Determination of Income or Loss—For taxable years beginning after 2007, Excess Contributions will be adjusted for any income or loss up to the end of the Plan Year to which such contributions were allocated. The income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions allocated to each Participant is the income or loss allocable to the Participant’s Elective Deferral account(s) for the Plan Year multiplied by a fraction, the numer-ator of which is such Participant’s Excess Contributions for the year and the denominator of which is the Participant’s Individual Account balance attributable to Elective Deferrals without regard to any income or loss occurring during such Plan Year. For taxable years beginning before 2008, income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions also included ten percent of the amount determined under the preceding sentence multiplied by the number of whole calendar months between the end of the Participant’s taxable year and the date of distribution, counting the month of distribution if distribution occurs after the 15th of such month. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Plan Administrator may compute the income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B) (i.e., the usual manner used by the Plan for allocating income or loss to Participants’ Individual Accounts or any reasonable method), provided such method is used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year. The Plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the income or loss on Excess Contributions merely because the income allocable is based on a date that is no more than seven days before the distribution.C. Accounting for Excess Contributions—Excess Contributions allocated to a Participant will be distributed from the Participant’s Elective Deferral account(s) in proportion to the Participant’s Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year. For years beginning after 2005, the Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, will either determine whether the distribution of Excess Contributions for a year will be made ﬁ rst from the Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferral account or the Roth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, to the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify otherwise. 5.14 Loans to ParticipantsIf the Adoption Agreement so indicates, a Participant may receive a loan from the Fund, subject to the following rules and the Plan’s loan policy.A. Loans will be made available to all Participants on a reasonably equivalent basis. Notwithstanding the preceding, new loans will not be available to Participants who cease to be employed by the Employer, unless such Participants are parties-in-interest as deﬁ ned in ERISA section 3(14). In addition, existing loans will be considered due and payable at such time as a Participant ceases to be an Employee, and the loan will be considered in default and the Participant’s Individual Account will be reduced by the outstanding amount of the loan unless otherwise speciﬁ ed in the loan policy statement or other loan documen-tation.B. Loans will not be made available to Highly Compensated Employees in an amount greater than the amount made available to other Employees.C. Loans must be adequately secured and bear a reasonable interest rate.D. No Participant loan will exceed the Present Value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account. E. A Participant must obtain the consent of their Spouse, if any, to the use of the Individual Account as security for the loan. Spousal consent will be obtained no earlier than the beginning of the 90-day period that ends on the date on which the loan is to be so secured. The consent must be in writing (or any other form permitted by the IRS and DOL), must acknowledge the effect of the loan, and must be witnessed by a notary public or plan representative. Such consent will thereafter be binding with respect to the consenting Spouse or any subsequent Spouse with respect to that loan. A new consent will be required if the Individual Account is used for renegotiation, extension, renewal, or other revision of the loan. Notwithstanding the preceding, no spousal consent is necessary if, at the time the loan is secured, no consent would be required for a distribution under Code section 417(a)(2)(B). In addition, spousal consent is not required if the Plan or the Participant is not subject to Code section 401(a)(11) at the time the Individual Account is used as security, or if the total Individual Account subject to the secu-rity is less than or equal to $5,000.F. In the event of default, foreclosure on the note and attachment of security will not occur until a distribution eligibility requirement is met under the Plan.G. For plan loans made before January 1, 2002, no loans will be made to any shareholder-employee or Owner-Employee. For purposes of this requirement, a shareholder-employee means an employee or ofﬁ cer of an electing small business (Subchapter S) corporation who owns (or is considered as owning within the meaning of Code section 318(a)(1)), on any day during the taxable year of such corporation, more than ﬁ ve-percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation.H. Loan repayments will be suspended under the Plan as permitted under Code section 414(u)(4) (USERRA).I. For years beginning after 2005, if the Participant’s Individual Account contains any combination of Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals, the speciﬁ c rules governing the loan program may Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1224-25 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

To the extent permitted by law and related regula-tions, the rules established by the Plan Sponsor may specify the order-ing rules to be applied in the event of a defaulted loan.If a valid spousal consent has been obtained in accordance with Plan Section 5.14(E), then, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, the portion of the Participant’s Individual Account used as a security interest held by the Plan by reason of a loan outstanding to the Participant will be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of the Individual Account payable at the time of death or distri-bution, but only if the reduction is used as repayment of the loan. If less than 100 percent of the Participant’s Individual Account (deter-mined without regard to the preceding sentence) is payable to the surviving Spouse, then the Individual Account will be adjusted by ﬁ rst reducing the Individual Account by the amount of the security used as repayment of the loan, and then determining the beneﬁ t payable to the surviving Spouse.To avoid taxation to the Participant, unless otherwise permitted by law or regulatory guidance, no loan to any Participant or Beneﬁ ciary can be made to the extent that such loan, when added to the outstanding balance of all other loans to the Participant, would exceed the lesser of 1) $50,000 reduced by the excess (if any) of the highest outstanding balance of loans during the one year period ending on the day before the loan is made, over the outstanding balance of loans from the Plan on the date the loan is made, or 2) 50 percent of the Present Value of the nonforfeitable Individual Account of the Participant. For the purpose of the above limitation, all loans from all plans of the Employer and other members of a group of employers described in Code sections 414(b), 414(c), and 414(m) are aggregated. Furthermore, any loan will by its terms require that repayment (principal and interest) be amortized in level payments, not less frequently than quarterly, over a period not extending beyond ﬁ ve years from the date of the loan, unless such loan is used to acquire a dwelling unit which, within a reasonable time (deter-mined at the time the loan is made), will be used as the principal resi-dence of the Participant. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Participant will suspend their loan repayments under this Plan as permitted under Code section 414(u)(4). An assignment or pledge of any portion of the Participant’s interest in the Plan and a loan, pledge, or assignment with respect to any insurance contract purchased under the Plan, will be treated as a loan under this paragraph.The Plan Administrator shall administer the loan program in accordance with speciﬁ c rules that are documented either in writing or in such other format as permitted by the IRS and the DOL. Such rules will include, at a minimum, the following: 1) the identity of the person or positions authorized to administer the Participant loan program, 2) the procedure for applying for loans, 3) the basis on which loans will be approved or denied, 4) limitations (if any) on the types and amounts of loans offered, 5) the procedure under the program for determining a reason-able rate of interest, 6) the types of collateral that may secure a Participant loan, and 7) the events constituting default and the steps that will be taken to preserve Plan assets in the event of such default.Section Six: Deﬁ nitionsWords and phrases used in the Plan with initial capital letters will, for the purpose of this Plan, have the meanings set forth in the portion of the Plan entitled “Deﬁ nitions” unless the context indicates that other meanings are intended. Section Seven: Miscellaneous7.01 The FundA. Establishment and Maintenance—By adopting this Plan, the Employer establishes the Fund, which will consist of the assets of the Plan held by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) pursuant to Section Eight. Assets within the Fund may be pooled on behalf of all Participants, earmarked on behalf of each Participant, or be a combina-tion of pooled and earmarked assets. To the extent that assets are earmarked for a particular Participant, they will be held in a Separate Fund for that Participant. No part of the corpus or income of the Fund may be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive beneﬁ t of Participants or their Beneﬁ ciaries. The Fund will be valued each Valuation Date at fair market value. B. Division of Fund Into Investment Funds—The Employer may direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to divide and redivide the Fund into one or more Investment Funds. Such Investment Funds may include, but are not limited to, Investment Funds representing the assets under the control of an investment manager pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(C) and Investment Funds representing investment options available for individual direction by Participants pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(B). Upon each division or redivision, the Employer may specify the part of the Fund to be allocated to each such Investment Fund and the terms and conditions, if any, under which the assets in such Investment Fund will be invested.7.02 Individual AccountsA. Establishment and Maintenance—The Plan Administrator shall estab-lish and maintain an Individual Account in the name of each Participant to reﬂ ect the total value of their interest in the Fund (including but not limited to Employer Contributions and earnings thereon). Each Individual Account established hereunder will consist of such subaccounts as may be needed for each Participant, including: 1. a subaccount to reﬂ ect Employer Contributions allocated on behalf of a Participant; 2. a subaccount to reﬂ ect a Participant’s rollover contributions; 3. a subaccount to reﬂ ect a Participant’s transfer contributions; 4. a subaccount to reﬂ ect a Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals; and5. a subaccount to reﬂ ect a Participant’s Roth Elective Deferrals.The Plan Administrator may establish additional accounts as it may deem necessary for the proper administration of the Plan. If this Plan is funded by individual contracts that provide a Participant’s Beneﬁ t under the Plan, such individual contracts will constitute the Participant’s Individual Account. If this Plan is funded by group contracts under the group annuity or group insurance contract, premiums or other consideration received by the insurance company must be allocated to Participants’ Individual Accounts under the Plan.B. Valuation of Individual Accounts1. Where all or a portion of the assets of a Participant’s Individual Account are invested in a Separate Fund for the Participant, then the value of that portion of such Participant’s Individual Account at any relevant time equals the sum of the fair market values of the assets in such Separate Fund, less any applicable charges or penalties.2. The fair market value of the remainder of each Individual Account is determined in the following manner:a. Separate Fund—First, the portion of the Individual Account invested in each Investment Fund as of the previous Valuation Date is determined. Each such portion is reduced by any withdrawal made from the applicable Investment Fund to or for the beneﬁ t of a Participant or the Participant’s Beneﬁ ciary, further reduced by any transfer to another Investment Fund since the previous Valuation Date, and is increased by any amount transferred from another Investment Fund since the previous Valuation Date. The resulting amounts are the net Individual Account portions invested in the Investment Funds.b. No Separate Fund—Second, the net Individual Account portions invested in each Investment Fund are adjusted upwards or down-wards, pro rata (i.e., using the ratio of each net Individual Account portion to the sum of all net Individual Account portions) so that the sum of all the net Individual Account portions invested in an \fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1224-25 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, for the ﬁ rst Plan Year only, the net Individual Account portions will be the sum of all contributions made to each Participant’s Individual Account during the ﬁ rst Plan Year.c. Allocations—Third, any contributions to the Plan are allocated in accordance with the appropriate allocation provisions of Plan Section Three. For purposes of this Plan Section Seven, contributions made by the Employer for any Plan Year but after that Plan Year will be considered to have been made on the last day of that Plan Year regardless of when paid to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). Amounts contributed between Valuation Dates will not be credited with investment gains or losses until the next following Valuation Date.d. Aggregation of Portions—Finally, the portions of the Individual Account invested in each Investment Fund (determined in accor-dance with (a), (b), and (c) above) are added together.C. Modiﬁ cation of Method for Valuing Individual Accounts—If neces-sary or appropriate, the Plan Administrator may establish different or additional procedures (which will be uniform and nondiscrimina-tory) for determining the fair market value of the Individual Accounts including, but not limited to, valuation on a daily basis pursuant to the number of shares of each permissible investment held on behalf of a Participant. 7.03 Powers and Duties of the Plan AdministratorA. The Plan Administrator will have the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall administer the Plan for the exclusive beneﬁ t of the Participants and their Beneﬁ ciaries in accordance with the speciﬁ c terms of the Plan.B. The Plan Administrator may, by appointment, allocate the duties of the Plan Administrator among several individuals or entities. Such appointments will not be effective until the party designated accepts such appointment in writing.C. The Plan Administrator shall be charged with the duties of the general administration of the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following:1. to determine all questions of interpretation or policy in a manner consistent with the Plan’s documents. The Plan Administrator’s construction or determination in good faith will be conclusive and binding on all persons except as otherwise provided herein or by law. Any interpretation or construction will be done in a nondiscriminatory manner and will be consistent with the intent that the Plan will con-tinue to be deemed a qualiﬁ ed plan under the terms of Code section 401(a), as amended from time to time, and will comply with the terms of ERISA, as amended from time to time;2. to determine all questions relating to the eligibility of Employees to become or remain Participants hereunder;3. to compute the amounts necessary or desirable to be contributed to the Plan;4. to compute the amount and kind of beneﬁ ts to which a Participant or Beneﬁ ciary will be entitled under the Plan and to direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) with respect to all disbursements under the Plan, and, when requested by the Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-cable), to furnish the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) with instructions, in writing, on matters pertaining to the Plan on which the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) may rely and act;5. to maintain all records necessary for the administration of the Plan;6. to prepare and ﬁ le such disclosures and tax forms as may be required from time to time by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of the Treasury; 7. to furnish each Employee, Participant, or Beneﬁ ciary such notices, information, and reports under such circumstances as may be required by law;8. to periodically review the performance of each Fiduciary and all other relevant parties to ensure such individuals’ obligations under the Plan are performed in a manner that is acceptable under the Plan and applicable law; and 9. to furnish a statement to each Participant or Beneﬁ ciary no later than 270 days after the close of each Plan Year, indicating the Individual Account balances of such Participant as of the last Valuation Date in such Plan Year.D. The Plan Administrator will have all of the powers necessary or appropriate to accomplish their duties under the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following:1. to appoint and retain such persons as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Plan Administrator;2. to appoint and retain counsel, specialists, or other persons as the Plan Administrator deems necessary or advisable in the administra-tion of the Plan;3. to resolve all questions of administration of the Plan;4. to establish such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules that it deems necessary to carry out the terms of the Plan;5. to make any adjustments in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner that it deems necessary to correct any arithmetical or accounting errors that may have been made for any Plan Year;6. to correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsis-tency in such manner and to such extent as will be deemed neces-sary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the Plan; and7. if the Plan permits a form of distribution other than a lump sum, and a Participant elects such form of distribution, the Plan Administrator may place that Participant’s Individual Account into a segregated Investment Fund for the purpose of maintaining the necessary liquid-ity to provide beneﬁ t installments on a periodic basis. 7.04 Expenses and CompensationAll reasonable expenses of administration, including, but not limited to, those involved in retaining necessary professional assistance, may be paid from the assets of the Fund. Alternatively, the Employer may, in its discretion, pay any or all such expenses. Pursuant to uniform and non-discriminatory rules that the Plan Administrator may establish from time to time, administrative expenses and expenses unique to a particular Participant or group of Participants may be charged to the Individual Account of such Participant or may be assessed against terminated Participants even if not assessed against active Participants (subject to rules promulgated by the IRS and the DOL), or the Plan Administrator may allow Participants to pay such fees outside of the Plan. The Employer shall furnish the Plan Administrator with such clerical and other assistance as the Plan Administrator may need in the perfor-mance of their duties.7.05 Information from EmployerTo enable the Plan Administrator to perform their duties, the Employer shall supply complete, accurate, and timely information to the Plan Administrator (or their designated agents) on all matters relating to the Compensation of all Participants; their regular employment; retirement, death, Disability, Severance from Employment, or Termination of Employment; and such other pertinent facts as the Plan Administrator (or their agents) may require. The Plan Administrator shall advise the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) of such of the preceding facts as may be pertinent to the Trustee’s (or Custodian’s) duties under the Plan. The Plan Administrator (or their agents) is entitled to rely on such infor-mation as is supplied by the Employer and will have no duty or responsi-bility to verify such information. Such information, including authorizations and directions, may be exchanged among the Employer, the Plan Administrator, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), or their agents through electronic, telephonic, or other means (including, for example, through the internet) pursuant to applicable servicing arrange-ments in effect for the Plan.Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1226-27 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Right of Prototype Document Sponsor to Amend the Plan or Terminate Sponsorship1. The Employer, by adopting the Plan, expressly delegates to the Prototype Document Sponsor the power, but not the duty, to amend the Plan without any further action or consent of the Employer as the Prototype Document Sponsor deems either necessary for the purpose of adjusting the Plan to comply with all laws and regulations governing pension or proﬁ t sharing plans or desirable to the extent consistent with such laws and regulations. Speciﬁ cally, it is under-stood that the amendments may be made unilaterally by the Prototype Document Sponsor. However, it will be understood that the Prototype Document Sponsor will be under no obligation to amend the Plan documents, and the Employer expressly waives any rights or claims against the Prototype Document Sponsor for not exercising this power to amend. For purposes of Prototype Document Sponsor amendments, the mass submitter will generally be recognized as the agent of the Prototype Document Sponsor. If the Prototype Document Sponsor does not adopt IRS model amendments adopted by the mass submitter, the Plan will no longer be identical to or a minor modiﬁ er of the mass submitter plan and will be considered an individually designed plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, the adop-tion of good faith IRS amendments must be accomplished pursuant to the rules for each such amendment as prescribed by the IRS. However, for purposes of reliance on an opinion letter, the Prototype Document Sponsor will no longer have the authority to amend the Plan on behalf of the Employer as of the date the Employer amends the Plan to incorporate a type of plan that is not permitted under the prototype program, or as of the date the IRS notiﬁ es the Employer that the Plan is an individually designed plan due to the nature and extent of the Employer’s amendments to the Plan.2. An amendment by the Prototype Document Sponsor will be accom-plished by giving notice (either in writing or in any other form permit-ted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Adopting Employer of the amendment to be made. The notice will set forth the text of such amendment and the date such amendment is to be effective. Such amendment will take effect unless within the 30-day period after such notice is provided, or within such shorter period as the notice may specify, the Adopting Employer gives the Prototype Document Sponsor written notice of refusal to consent to the amendment. Such written notice of refusal will have the effect of withdrawing the Plan as a prototype plan and will cause the Plan to be considered an individually designed plan. 3. In addition to the amendment rights described above, the Prototype Document Sponsor will have the right to terminate its sponsorship of this Plan by providing notice (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Adopting Employer of such termination. Such termination of sponsor-ship will have the effect of withdrawing the Plan as a prototype plan and will cause the Plan to be considered an individually designed plan. The Prototype Document Sponsor will have the right to termi-nate its sponsorship of this Plan regardless of whether the Prototype Document Sponsor has terminated sponsorship with respect to other employers adopting its prototype Plan.B. Right of Adopting Employer to Amend the Plan—The Adopting Employer may amend the Plan to 1. change options previously selected in the Adoption Agreement; 2. add overriding language in the Adoption Agreement when such lan-guage is necessary to satisfy Code section 415 or Code section 416 because of the required aggregation of multiple plans;3. amend administrative provisions of the trust or custodial document in the case of a nonstandardized plan and make more limited amendments in the case of a standardized plan, such as the name of the Plan, Employer, Trustee or Custodian, Plan Administrator and other Fiduciaries, the trust year, and the name of pooled trust in which the Plan’s trust will participate;4. add certain sample and model amendments published by the IRS or other required good faith amendments, that speciﬁ cally provide that their adoption will not cause the Plan to be treated as individually designed; and5. add or change provisions permitted under the Plan or specify or change the Effective Date of a provision as permitted under the Plan.An Adopting Employer that amends the Plan for any other reason, includ-ing a waiver of the minimum funding requirement under Code section 412(d), will no longer participate in this prototype plan and will be con-sidered to have an individually designed plan.An Adopting Employer who wishes to amend the Plan shall document the amendment in writing, executed by a duly authorized ofﬁ cer of the Adopting Employer. If the amendment is in the form of a restated Adoption Agreement, the amendment will become effective on the date provided in the Adoption Agreement. Any other amendment will become effective as described therein upon execution by the Adopting Employer and, if appropriate, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). A copy of a restated Adoption Agreement or other amendment must be provided to the Prototype Document Sponsor and the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) before the effective date of the amendment.The Adopting Employer further reserves the right to replace the Plan in its entirety by adopting another retirement plan which the Adopting Employer designates as a replacement plan.C. Limitation on Power to Amend—No amendment to the Plan will be effective to the extent that it has the effect of decreasing a Participant’s accrued beneﬁ t. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participant’s Individual Account may be reduced to the extent permit-ted under Code section 412(d)(2) or to the extent permitted under Treasury Regulations sections 1.411(d)-3 and 1.411(d)-4. For purposes of this paragraph, a Plan amendment that has the effect of decreasing a Participant’s Individual Account with respect to beneﬁ ts attributable to service before the amendment will be treated as reducing an accrued beneﬁ t. For purposes of this paragraph, a Participant will not accrue a right to an allocation of an Employer Proﬁ t Sharing Contribution or Employer Money Purchase Pension Contribution for the current Plan Year until the last day of such Plan Year and after the application of all amendments required or permitted by the IRS. No amendment to the Plan will be effective to eliminate or restrict an optional form of beneﬁ t. The preceding sentence will not apply to a Plan amendment that eliminates or restricts the ability of a Participant to receive payment of their Individual Account under a particular optional form of beneﬁ t if the amendment provides a single-sum distribution form. Where this Plan document is being adopted to amend another plan that contains a protected beneﬁ t not provided for in this document, the Employer must complete a “Protected Beneﬁ t and Prior Plan Document Provisions Attachment,” describing such protected beneﬁ t which, will become part of the Plan.7.07 Plan Merger or ConsolidationIn the case of any merger or consolidation of the Plan with, or transfer of assets or liabilities of such Plan to, any other plan, each Participant will be entitled to receive beneﬁ ts immediately after the merger, consolida-tion, or transfer (if the Plan had then terminated) that are equal to or greater than the beneﬁ ts they would have been entitled to receive imme-diately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the Plan had then terminated). The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) has the authority to enter into merger agreements or agreements to directly transfer the assets of this Plan, but only if such agreements are made with trustees or custodians of other retirement plans described in Code section 401(a) or such other plans permitted by laws or regulations. If it is later deter-mined that all or part of a non-elective transfer was ineligible to be transferred into the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto (deter-mined in the manner described in Plan Section7.02(B)), be returned to the transferor plan or correct the ineligible transfer using any other method permitted by the IRS under regulation or other guidance.\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1226-27 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Neither the Adoption Agreement nor the Plan nor any amendment or modiﬁ cation thereof nor the making of contributions hereunder will be construed as giving any Participant or any other person any legal or equitable right against the Employer, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), the Plan Administrator, or the Prototype Document Sponsor except as speciﬁ cally provided herein, or as provided by law.7.09 Method and Procedure for TerminationThe Plan may be terminated by the Adopting Employer at any time by appropriate action of its managing body. Such termination will be effec-tive on the date speciﬁ ed by the Adopting Employer. The Plan shall terminate, if required by either the IRS or the DOL, if the Adopting Employer is dissolved or terminated. Written notice of the termination and effective date thereof will be given to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), Plan Administrator, Prototype Document Sponsor, and the Participants and Beneﬁ ciaries of deceased Participants. The required ﬁ lings (such as the Form 5500 series and others) must be made by the Adopting Employer with the IRS and any other regulatory body as required by current laws and regulations. Until all of the assets have been distributed from the Fund, the Adopting Employer must keep the Plan in compliance with current laws and regulations by making appro-priate amendments to the Plan and by taking such other measures as may be required. If the Plan is abandoned by the Adopting Employer, however, a qualiﬁ ed termination administrator (QTA) (or other entity permitted by the IRS or DOL) may terminate the Plan according to rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, a reversion to the Employer of amounts contributed to the Plan that exceed the limitations imposed under Code section 415(c) may occur upon termination of the Plan according to rules promulgated by the IRS. 7.10 Continuance of Plan by Successor EmployerNotwithstanding the preceding Plan Section 7.09, a successor of the Adopting Employer may continue the Plan and be substituted in the place of the present Adopting Employer. The successor and the present Adopting Employer (or, if deceased, the executor of the estate of a deceased Self-Employed Individual who was the Adopting Employer) must execute a written instrument authorizing such substitution, and the successor shall amend the Plan in accordance with Plan Section 7.06.7.11 Failure of Plan Qualiﬁ cationIf the Plan fails to retain its qualiﬁ ed status, the Plan will no longer be considered to be part of a prototype plan, and such Employer can no longer participate under this prototype. In such event, the Plan will be considered an individually designed plan.7.12 Governing Laws and ProvisionsTo the extent such laws are not preempted by federal law, the terms and conditions of this Plan will be governed by the laws of the state in which the Prototype Document Sponsor is located, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Prototype Document Sponsor and the Employer.In the event of any conﬂ ict between the provisions of this Basic Plan Document and provisions of the Adoption Agreement, the summary plan description, or any related documents, the Basic Plan Document will control.7.13 State Community Property LawsThe terms and conditions of this Plan will be applicable without regard to the community property laws of any state.7.14 HeadingsThe headings of the Plan have been inserted for convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in any construction of the provisions hereof.7.15 Gender and NumberWhenever any words are used herein in the masculine gender, they will be construed as though they were also used in the feminine gender in all cases where they would so apply, and whenever any words are used herein in the singular form, they will be construed as though they were also used in the plural form in all cases where they would so apply.7.16 Standard of Fiduciary ConductThe Employer, Plan Administrator, Trustee, and any other Fiduciary under this Plan shall discharge their duties with respect to this Plan solely in the interests of Participants and their Beneﬁ ciaries, and with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims. No Fiduciary will cause the Plan to engage in any transaction known as a “non-exempt prohibited transaction” under either the Code or ERISA.7.17 General Undertaking of all PartiesAll parties to this Plan and all persons claiming any interest whatsoever hereunder agree to perform any and all acts and execute any and all documents and papers that may be necessary or desirable for the carrying out of this Plan and any of its provisions.7.18 Agreement Binds Heirs, Etc.This Plan shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns as those terms will apply to any and all parties hereto, present and future.7.19 Determination of Top-Heavy Status A. In General—Except as provided in Plan Section 7.19(B), this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan if any of the following conditions exist:1. if the top-heavy ratio for this Plan exceeds 60 percent and this Plan is not part of any Required Aggregation Group or Permissive Aggregation Group of plans;2. if this Plan is part of a Required Aggregation Group of plans but not part of a Permissive Aggregation Group and the top-heavy ratio for the group of plans exceeds 60 percent; or3. if this Plan is a part of a Required Aggregation Group and part of a Permissive Aggregation Group of plans and the top-heavy ratio for the Permissive Aggregation Group exceeds 60 percent.B.

If the Employer maintains one or more deﬁ ned contribution plans (including any simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan) and the Employer has not maintained any deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan that during the ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date(s) has or has had accrued beneﬁ ts, the top-heavy ratio for this Plan alone or for the Required or Permissive Aggregation Group as appropriate is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the account balances of all Key Employees as of the Determination Date(s) (including any part of any account balance distributed in the one-year period ending on the Determination Date(s) (ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002)) and the denominator of which is the sum of all account balances (including any part of any account balance distrib-uted in the one-year period ending on the Determination Date(s), (ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1228-29 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Both the numerator and the denominator of the top-heavy ratio are increased to reﬂ ect any contribution not actually made as of the Determination Date, but that is required to be taken into account on that date under Code section 416 and the corre-sponding regulations.2. If the Employer maintains one or more deﬁ ned contribution plans (including any simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan) and the Employer maintains or has maintained one or more deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans that during the ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date(s) has or has had any accrued beneﬁ ts, the top-heavy ratio for any Required or Permissive Aggregation Group, as appropriate, is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of account balances under the aggregated deﬁ ned contribution plan or plans for all Key Employees, determined in accordance with 1) above, and the Present Value of accrued beneﬁ ts under the aggregated deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan or plans for all Key Employees as of the Determination Date(s), and the denominator of which is the sum of the account balances under the aggregated deﬁ ned contribution plan or plans for all Participants, determined in accordance with 1) above, and the Present Value of accrued beneﬁ ts under the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan or plans for all Participants as of the Determination Date(s), all deter-mined in accordance with Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations. The accrued beneﬁ ts under a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan in both the numerator and denominator of the top-heavy ratio are increased for any distribution of an accrued beneﬁ t made in the one-year period ending on the Determination Date (ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002).3. For purposes of (1) and (2) above, the value of account balances and the Present Value of accrued beneﬁ ts will be determined as of the most recent Valuation Date that falls within or ends with the 12-month period ending on the Determination Date, except as pro-vided in Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations for the ﬁ rst and second plan years of a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan. The account balances and accrued beneﬁ ts of a Participant 1) who is not a Key Employee but who was a Key Employee in a prior year, or 2) who has not been credited with at least one Hour of Service with any employer maintaining the plan at any time during the one-year period (ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002) ending on the Determination Date will be disregarded. The calculation of the top-heavy ratio, and the extent to which distributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken into account will be made in accordance with Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations. Deductible employee contributions will not be taken into account for purposes of computing the top-heavy ratio. When aggregating plans, the value of account balances and accrued beneﬁ ts will be calculated with reference to the Determination Dates that fall within the same calendar year. The accrued beneﬁ t of a Participant other than a Key Employee will be determined under 1) the method, if any, that uniformly applies for accrual purposes under all deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans maintained by the Employer, or 2) if there is no such method, as if such beneﬁ t accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under the fractional rule of Code section 411(b)(1)(C).7.20 Inalienability of Beneﬁ tsNo beneﬁ t or interest available under the Plan will be subject to assign-ment or alienation, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The preceding sen-tence will not apply to judgments and settlements described in Code section 401(a)(13)(C) and ERISA section 206(d)(4). Such sentence will, however, apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any beneﬁ t payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a Domestic Relations Order, unless such order is determined to be a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order as deﬁ ned in the Deﬁ nitions Section of the Plan.Generally, a Domestic Relations Order cannot be a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order until January 1, 1985. However, in the case of a Domestic Relations Order entered before January 1, 1985, the Plan Administrator:1. shall treat such order as a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order if the Plan Administrator is paying beneﬁ ts pursuant to such order on January 1, 1985; and2. may treat any other such order entered before January 1, 1985, as a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order even if such order does not meet the requirements of Code section 414(p). Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, a distribu-tion to an Alternate Payee under a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order will be permitted even if the Participant affected by such order is not otherwise entitled to a distribution, and even if such Participant has not attained the earliest retirement age as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(p).7.21 BondingEvery Fiduciary and every person who handles funds or other property of the Plan shall be bonded to the extent required by ERISA section 412 and the corresponding regulations for purposes of protecting the Plan against loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on the part of the person, group, or class, alone or in connivance with others, to be cov-ered by such bond. The amount of the bond will be ﬁ xed at the begin-ning of each Plan Year and will not be less than ten-percent of the amount of funds handled. The amount of funds handled will be deter-mined by the funds handled the previous Plan Year or, if none, the amount of funds estimated, in accordance with rules provided by the Secretary of Labor, to be handled during the current Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding, no bond will be less than $1,000 nor more than $500,000, except that the Secretary of Labor will have the right to prescribe an amount in excess of $500,000. In the case of a Plan that holds employer securities (within the meaning of ERISA sec-tion 407(d)(1)), the maximum bond amount is $1,000,000 or such other amount as the Secretary of Labor prescribes.7.22 Investment AuthorityA. Plan Investments—Except as provided in Plan Section 7.22(B) (relat-ing to individual direction of investments by Participants), the Adopting Employer, not the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), will have exclu-sive management and control over the investment of the Fund into any permitted investment. The Adopting Employer will be responsible for establishing a funding policy statement on behalf of the Plan and shall provide a copy of such funding policy statement to the Discretionary Trustee, if any. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Trustee is desig-nated as a Discretionary Trustee in the Adoption Agreement, such Discretionary Trustee may enter into an agreement with the Adopting Employer whereby the Discretionary Trustee will manage the investment of all or a portion of the Fund. Any such agreement will be in writing and will set forth such matters as the Discretionary Trustee deems neces-sary or desirable.B. Direction of Investments by Participants—Each Participant will have the responsibility for directing the Trustee (or Custodian, if provided for under a separate agreement between the Adopting Employer and the Custodian), regarding the investment of all or part of their Individual Account. If all of the requirements pertaining to Participant direction of investment in ERISA section 404(c)(1) are satisﬁ ed, then to the extent so directed, the Adopting Employer, Plan Administrator, Trustee, Custodian (if applicable), and all other Fiduciaries are relieved of Fiduciary liability under ERISA section 404. The Plan Administrator shall direct that a Separate Fund be established in the name of each Participant who directs the investment of part or all of their Individual Account. Each Separate Fund will be charged or cred-ited (as appropriate) with the earnings, gains, losses, or expenses attributable to such Separate Fund. No Fiduciary will be liable for any loss that results from a Participant’s individual direction. The assets subject to individual direction will not be invested in collectibles as that term is deﬁ ned in Code section 408(m). \fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1228-29 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Mgr.Maribeth McLarenFontsITC Franklin Gothic Std (Book, Me-dium, Demi; OpenType)GraphicsJanet LevyDETAILSJob TypeLithoMech Scale100%Output Size100%Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document 29The Plan Administrator shall establish such uniform and nondiscrimina-tory rules relating to individual direction as it deems necessary or advis-able including, but not limited to, rules describing 1) which portions of Participants’ Individual Accounts can be individually directed, 2) the frequency of investment changes, 3) the forms and procedures for making investment changes, and 4) the effect of a Participant’s failure to make a valid direction. The Plan Administrator may, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, limit the available investments for Participants’ individual direction to certain speciﬁ ed investment options (including, but not limited to, cer-tain mutual funds, investment contracts, deposit accounts, and group trusts). The Plan Administrator may permit, in a uniform and nondis-criminatory manner, a Beneﬁ ciary of a deceased Participant or the Alternate Payee under a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order to individu-ally direct investments in accordance with this Plan Section 7.22(B). Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, if the Adoption Agreement names a Directed Trustee, such Participants will furnish investment instruction to the Plan Administrator under procedures adopted by the Adopting Employer and/or the Plan Administrator consis-tent with the Plan, and it will be the responsibility of the Plan Administrator to provide direction to the Directed Trustee regarding the investment of such amounts. If a Participant who has the right to direct investments under the terms of the Plan fails to provide such direction to the Plan Administrator, the Plan Administrator shall direct the invest-ment of such Participant’s Individual Accounts. The Plan Administrator shall maintain records showing the interest of each Participant and/or Beneﬁ ciary in the Fund unless the Directed Trustee enters into a written agreement with the Adopting Employer to keep separate accounts for each such Participant or Beneﬁ ciary. C. Investment Managers1. Deﬁ nition of Investment Manager—The Adopting Employer may appoint one or more investment managers to make investment decisions with respect to all or a portion of the Fund. The invest-ment manager will be any ﬁ rm or individual registered as an invest-ment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a bank as deﬁ ned in said Act, or an insurance company qualiﬁ ed under the laws of more than one state to perform services consisting of the management, acquisition, or disposition of any assets of the Plan. 2. Investment Manager’s Authority—A separate Investment Fund will be established representing the assets of the Fund invested at the direction of the investment manager. The investment manager so appointed shall direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) with respect to the investment of such Investment Fund. The investments that may be acquired at the direction of the investment manager are those described in Plan Section 7.22(D). 3. Written Agreement—The appointment of any investment manager will be by written agreement between the Adopting Employer and the investment manager, and a copy of such agreement (and any modiﬁ -cation or termination thereof) must be given to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). The agreement will set forth, among other matters, the effective date of the investment manager’s appointment and an acknowledgment by the investment manager that it is a Fiduciary of the Plan under ERISA. 4. Concerning the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable)—Written notice of each appointment of an investment manager will be given to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of such appointment. Such notice will specify which portion of the Fund will constitute the Investment Fund subject to the investment manager’s direction. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will comply with the investment direction given to it by the investment manager and will not be liable for any loss which may result by reason of any action (or inaction) it takes at the direction of the investment manager.D. Permissible Investments—The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) may invest the assets of the Plan in property of any character, real or personal, including, but not limited to, the following: stocks, including Qualifying Employer Securities, and including shares of open-end invest-ment companies (mutual funds); bonds; notes; debentures; proprietary mutual funds; deposit accounts; options; limited partnership interests; mortgages; real estate or any interests therein (including Qualifying Employer Real Property); unit investment trusts; Treasury Bills, and other U.S. Government obligations; common trust funds, combined investment trusts, collective trust funds or commingled funds main-tained by a bank or similar ﬁ nancial organization (whether or not the Trustee hereunder); savings accounts, certiﬁ cates of deposit, demand or time deposits or money market accounts of a bank or similar ﬁ nan-cial organization (whether or not the Trustee hereunder); annuity con-tracts that are “guaranteed beneﬁ t policies,” as deﬁ ned in ERISA section 401(b)(2)(B); life insurance policies; or in such other invest-ments as is deemed proper without regard to investments authorized by statute or rule of law governing the investment of trust funds but with regard to ERISA and this Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Prototype Document Sponsor may, as a condition of making the Plan available to the Adopting Employer, limit the types of property in which the assets of the Plan may be invested. The list of permissible investment options will be further limited in accordance with any appli-cable law, regulations, or other restrictions applicable to the Trustee or Custodian, including, but not limited to, internal operational procedures adopted by such Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). The actions of a Discretionary Trustee named in the Adoption Agreement will also be subject to the funding policy statement provided by the Adopting Employer. If any Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) invests all or any portion of the Fund pursuant to written instructions provided by the Adopting Employer (including an investment manager appointed by the Adopting Employer pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(C)) or any Participant pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(B), the Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-cable) will be deemed to have invested pursuant to the Adopting Employer’s funding policy statement.To the extent the assets of the Plan are invested in a group trust, including a collective trust fund or commingled funds maintained by a bank or similar ﬁ nancial organization, the declaration of trust of such composite trust will be deemed to be a part of the Plan, and any invest-ment in such composite trust will be subject to all of the provisions of such declaration of trust, as the same may be amended or supple-mented from time to time.If the responsibility for directing investments for Elective Deferrals (and earnings) is executed by someone other than the Participants, the acqui-sition of Qualifying Employer Securities and Qualifying Employer Real Property will be limited to ten-percent of the fair market value of the assets of the Plan, to the extent required by ERISA section 407(b)(2). E. Matters Relating to Insurance1. Unless prohibited by the Plan Sponsor pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(D), a life insurance contract may be purchased on behalf of a Participant. No life insurance contract may be purchased unless the insured under the contract is the Participant, the Participant’s Spouse or another individual in whom the Participant has an insur-able interest. If a life insurance contract is to be purchased for a Participant, the aggregate premium for certain life insurance for each Participant must be less than a certain percentage of the aggregate Employer Contributions allocated to a Participant’s Individual Account at any particular time as follows. a. Ordinary Life Insurance—For purposes of these incidental insur-ance provisions, ordinary life insurance contracts are contracts with both nondecreasing death beneﬁ ts and nonincreasing premiums. If such contracts are purchased, less than 50 percent of the aggre-gate Employer Contributions allocated to any Participant’s Individual Account will be used to pay the premiums attributable to them. b. Term and Universal Life Insurance—No more than 25 percent of the aggregate Employer Contributions allocated to any Participant’s Individual Account will be used to pay the premiums on term life insurance contracts, universal life insurance contracts, and all other life insurance contracts that are not ordinary life.

Combination—The sum of 50 percent of the ordinary life insurance premiums and all other life insurance premiums will not exceed 25 percent of the aggregate Employer Contributions allocated to any Participant’s Individual Account. The above incidental beneﬁ ts limits do not apply to life insurance con-tracts (1) purchased by an Employee who has been a Participant in the Plan for ﬁ ve or more years, (2) purchased with Employer Contributions that have been in the Participant’s Individual Account for at least two full Plan Years, measured from the date such contributions were allo-cated or (3) purchased using rollover contributions. For purposes of this Plan Section 7.22(E)(1), transfer contributions will be considered Employer Contributions, and therefore may be used to pay contract premiums. No part of the Deductible Employee Contribution account will be used to purchase life insurance.2. Any dividends or credits earned on insurance contracts for a Participant will be allocated to such Participant’s Individual Account derived from Employer Contributions for whose beneﬁ t the contract is held. 3. Subject to Plan Section 5.10, the contracts on a Participant’s life will be converted to cash or an annuity or distributed to the Participant upon separation from service with the Employer. In addi-tion, contracts on the joint lives of a Participant and another person may not be maintained under this Plan if such Participant ceases to have an insurable interest in such other person. 4. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) shall apply for and will be the owner of any insurance contract(s) purchased under the terms of this Plan. The insurance contract(s) must provide that proceeds will be payable to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). However, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be required to pay over all proceeds of the contract(s) to the Participant’s Designated Beneﬁ ciary in accordance with the distribution provisions of this Plan. A Participant’s Spouse will be the designated beneﬁ ciary of the proceeds in all circumstances unless a Qualiﬁ ed Election has been made in accordance with Plan Section 5.10. Under no circumstances will the Fund retain any part of the proceeds. In the event of any conﬂ ict between the terms of this Plan and the terms of any insur-ance contract purchased hereunder, the Plan provisions will control. 5. The Plan Administrator may direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-cable) to sell and distribute insurance or annuity contracts to a Participant (or other party as may be permitted) in accordance with applicable law or regulations. 6. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, and except as may be otherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify and hold harmless the insurer, its ofﬁ cers, directors, employees, agents, heirs, executors, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements, losses, costs, charges, or expenses (including legal expenses) at any time arising out of or incurred in connection with any action taken by such par-ties in the performance of their duties with respect to this Plan, unless there has been a ﬁ nal adjudication of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties. Further, except as may be otherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify the insurer from any liability, claim, or expense (including legal expense) that the insurer incurs by reason of, or which results in whole or in part from, the reliance of the insurer on the facts and other directions and elections the Employer communicates or fails to communicate.F. Diversiﬁ cation Requirements When Employer Securities are Held as Investments in the Plan—For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2007, Code section 401(a)(35) requires qualiﬁ ed retirement plans that hold employer securities to allow Participants, Alternate Payees with Individual Accounts under the Plan, or Beneﬁ ciaries of deceased Participants to diversify their investments. This Code section and other relevant guidance govern the diversiﬁ cation procedures, which include the following.1. Employee Contributions and Elective Deferrals Invested in Employer Securities—In the case of the portion of an Individual Account attrib-utable to Nondeductible Employee Contributions and Elective Deferrals (if applicable) that are invested in employer securities, the Participant, Alternate Payee, or Beneﬁ ciary, as applicable, may elect to direct the Plan to divest any such securities and to reinvest an equivalent amount in other investments that meet the investment option requirements below. 2. Employer Contributions Invested in Employer Securities—In the case of the portion of an Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions other than Elective Deferrals that are invested in employer securities, a Participant who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), an Alternative Payee with respect to a Participant who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if appli-cable), or a Beneﬁ ciary, as applicable, may elect to direct the Plan to divest any such securities and to reinvest an equivalent amount in other investments that meet the investment option requirements below. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Plan provides for imme-diate vesting, the three years of service requirement will be satisﬁ ed on the day immediately preceding the third anniversary of the Participant’s date of hire.3. Investment Options—The diversiﬁ cation requirements above are met if the Plan offers not less than three investment options, other than employer securities, to which a Participant, Alternate Payee, or Beneﬁ ciary, as applicable may direct the proceeds from the divest-ment of employer securities, each of which is diversiﬁ ed and has materially different risk and return characteristics. The Plan may limit the time for divestment and reinvestment to periodic, reasonable opportunities that occur no less frequently than quarterly. Except as provided in regulations, the Plan must not impose employer securi-ties investment restrictions or conditions that are not imposed on the investment of other Plan assets (other than restrictions or condi-tions imposed by securities laws or other relevant guidance) except that a Plan may allow for more frequent transfers to or from either a stable value fund or a qualiﬁ ed default investment alternative.4. Exception for Certain Plans—The diversiﬁ cation requirement does not apply to a one-Participant retirement plan, an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) if 1) there are no contributions or earnings in the ESOP that are held within such plan and that are subject to Code sections 401(k) or (m), and 2) such plan is a separate plan for purposes of Code section 414(l) with respect to any other deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan or deﬁ ned contribution plan maintained by the same employer or employers, or to a retirement plan where employer securities are held in an investment fund as described in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(35)-1(f)(2)(B)(3)(ii). 5. Transition Rule for Securities Attributable to Employer Contributions—In the case of the portion of an Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions other than Elective Deferrals that are invested in employer securities, including, a Participant who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), an Alternate Payee with respect to a Participant who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), or a Beneﬁ ciary, as appli-cable, the employer securities acquired in a Plan Year beginning before January 1, 2007, will be subject to the following divestiture and reinvestment transition schedule, which applies separately with respect to each class of securities.  For the Plan Year in which diversiﬁ cation requirement applies, the applicable percentage subject to diversiﬁ cation is: • First   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  33%• Second .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  66%• Third   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   100% This three-year phase-in requirement does not apply to a Participant who has attained age 55 and who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable) before the ﬁ rst Plan Year beginning after December 31, 2005.\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1230-31 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

To the extent provided in any Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order, the former Spouse of a Participant will be treated as a surviving Spouse of such Participant for purposes of any beneﬁ t payable in the form of either a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity.B. The Plan will not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of the Code, which generally prohibits payment of beneﬁ ts before the Participant’s Termination of Employment or Severance from Employment, as applicable, with the Employer, solely by reason of payments to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order.C. In the case of any Domestic Relations Order received by the Plan: 1. the Plan Administrator shall promptly notify the Participant and any other Alternate Payee of the receipt of such order and the Plan’s procedure for determining the qualiﬁ ed status of Domestic Relations Orders; and 2. within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the Plan Administrator shall determine whether such order is a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order and notify the Participant and each Alternate Payee of such determination.The Plan Administrator shall establish reasonable procedures to deter-mine the qualiﬁ ed status of Domestic Relations Orders and to adminis-ter distributions under such qualiﬁ ed orders.D. During any period in which the issue of whether a Domestic Relations Order is a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order is being determined by the Plan Administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, the Plan Administrator shall segregate in a separate account in the Plan or in an escrow account the amounts which would have been payable to the Alternate Payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order. If within 18 months the order or modiﬁ cation thereof is determined to be a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order, the Plan Administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (plus any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto. If within 18 months either 1) it is determined that the order is not a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order, or 2) the issue as to whether such order is a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order is not resolved, then the Plan Administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (plus any inter-est thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order. Any determination that an order is a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order that is made after the close of the 18-month period will be applied prospectively only.7.24 Indemniﬁ cation of Prototype Document Sponsor Notwithstanding any other provision herein, and except as may be other-wise provided by ERISA, the Employer shall indemnify and hold harm-less the Prototype Document Sponsor, its ofﬁ cers, directors, employees, agents, heirs, executors, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements, losses, costs, charges, or expenses (including legal expenses) at any time arising out of or incurred in connection with any action taken by such parties in the performance of their duties with respect to this Plan, unless there has been a ﬁ nal adjudication of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties. Further, except as may be otherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify the Prototype Document Sponsor from any liability, claim, or expense (including legal expense) that the Prototype Document Sponsor incurs by reason of, or which results in whole or in part from, the reliance of the Prototype Document Sponsor on the facts and other directions and elections the Employer, Plan Administrator, or Investment Fiduciary communicates or fails to communicate.7.25 Military ServiceNotwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, beneﬁ ts, and service credit with respect to qualiﬁ ed military service will be provided in accordance with Code section 414(u), including, but not limited to the following.A. Beneﬁ t Accrual in the Case of Death or Disability Resulting from Active Military Service.1. Beneﬁ t Accrual—If elected in the Adoption Agreement, for beneﬁ t accrual purposes, an individual who dies or becomes disabled while performing qualiﬁ ed military service (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(u)) will be treated as if the individual resumed employment in accordance with the individual’s reemployment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), on the day preceding death or Disability (as appli-cable) and terminated employment on the actual date of death or Disability. If the Employer elects to treat an individual as having resumed employment as described above, subject to items (2) and (3) below, any full or partial compliance by the Plan with respect to the beneﬁ t accrual requirements will be treated for purposes of Code section 414(u)(1) as if such compliance were required under USERRA. 2. Nondiscrimination Requirement—Part A, item (1) above will only apply if all individuals performing qualiﬁ ed military service with respect to the Employer (as determined under Code sections 414(b), (c), (m), and (o)) who die or became disabled as a result of perform-ing qualiﬁ ed military service (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(u)) before reemployment by the Employer are credited with service and beneﬁ ts on reasonably equivalent terms.3. Determination of Beneﬁ ts—The amount of Nondeductible Employee Contributions and the amount of Elective Deferrals of an Employee treated as reemployed under Part A, item (1) for purposes of apply-ing Code section 414(u)(8)(C) will be determined on the basis of the individual’s average actual Nondeductible Employee Contributions or Elective Deferrals for the lesser ofa. the 12-month period of service with the Employer immediately before qualiﬁ ed military service (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(u)), orb. if service with the Employer is less than such 12-month period, the actual length of continuous service with the Employer.B. Vesting in the Case of Disability Resulting from Active Military Service1. Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable)—If elected in the Adoption Agreement, for vesting purposes, an indi-vidual who becomes disabled while performing qualiﬁ ed military service (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(u)) will be treated as if the individual resumed employment in accordance with the individual’s reemployment rights under USERRA, on the day preceding Disability (as applicable) and terminated employment on the actual date of Disability. If the Employer elects to treat an individual as having resumed employment as described above, subject to item (2) below, compliance by the Plan with respect to the vesting requirements will be treated for purposes of Code section 414(u)(1) as if such compli-ance were required under USERRA.2. Nondiscrimination Requirements—Part B, item (1) above will apply to the extent permitted under other applicable rules, including the rules provided in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3), which provides nondiscrimination rules for crediting imputed service. Under Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3), the provisions crediting vesting service to any Highly Compensated Employee must apply on the same terms to all similarly situated non-Highly Compensated Employees. C. Death Beneﬁ ts—In the case of an individual Participant who dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing qualiﬁ ed military service (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(u)), the Participant’s survivors are entitled to any additional beneﬁ ts (other than beneﬁ t accruals relating to the period of qualiﬁ ed military service) provided under the Plan had the Participant resumed employment with the Employer and then terminated employment on account of death.Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1232-33 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The Adopting Employer represents and warrants to the entity that it has all requisite right, power, and authority and has taken all required actions necessary under the Plan and applicable law to designate the ﬁ nancial organization as Custodian of the Plan pursuant to the terms of the Basic Plan Document. The Employer, Plan Administrator, any Trustee, any other Investment Fiduciary, and the Custodian so appointed will be bound by all the terms of this Basic Plan Document and Adoption Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision hereof regarding the responsibilities of or granting powers to the Custodian, the Custodian will serve as a nondiscretionary, directed Custodian of the Fund, will have no discretionary authority with respect to the management or administration of the Plan or the Fund, and will act only as directed by the entity or individual who has such authority. A. Responsibilities of the Custodian—The Custodian’s responsibilities may be further limited by the Plan Trustee(s) and, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, may also be further limited by the terms of a separate agreement between the Custodian and the Adopting Employer. Subject to the previous sentence, the responsibilities of the Custodian will be limited to the following.1. To receive Plan contributions and to hold, invest and reinvest, and distribute the Fund as authorized by the Adopting Employer or its designee without distinction between principal and interest; pro-vided, however, that nothing in this Plan will require the Custodian to maintain physical custody of stock certiﬁ cates (or other indicia of ownership of any type of asset) representing assets within the Fund.2. To maintain accurate records of contributions, investments, earn-ings, receipts, disbursements, withdrawals, and other transactions with respect to the Fund, and all accounts, books, and records relating thereto will be open at all reasonable times to inspection and audit by any person designated by the Employer; provided, however, that the Custodian is given reasonable advance notice of such inspection by the Employer. On direction of the Adopting Employer or Plan Administrator, and if agreed to in writing by the Custodian, the Custodian may provide annual or interim account-ings, valuations, or other reports concerning the assets of the custodial account subject to payment of all required additional fees for such reports. The Custodian’s accounting will be at the Custodial Account level rather than the Participant level, and the Custodian will not be responsible for Participant-level record-keep-ing, reporting, or communication unless it agrees to do so in a separate written agreement with the Adopting Employer or Plan Administrator. The Custodian will also furnish the Adopting Employer with such other information as the Custodian possesses and which is necessary for the Adopting Employer to comply with the reporting requirements of ERISA, as applicable. An accounting will be deemed to have been approved by the Adopting Employer unless the Adopting Employer or Plan Administrator objects to the contents of an accounting within sixty (60) days of its mailing or electronic transmission by the Custodian. Any objections must set forth the speciﬁ c grounds on which they are based. Upon approval, the Custodian will be forever released from any and all liability with respect to the Account.3. To make disbursements from the Fund to Participants or Beneﬁ ciaries upon the proper authorization of the Plan Administrator.4. To furnish to the Plan Administrator an annual statement that reﬂ ects the value of the investments in the custody of the Custodian as of the end of the period and as of any other times as the Custodian and Plan Administrator may agree to in writing, including an agreement regarding the application of additional fees for such additional report.5. To invest the Fund only in investment options selected by the Investment Fiduciary. Such selection will be made from among the types of property that the Prototype Document Sponsor makes available in Plan Section 7.22(D). Notwithstanding the ﬁ rst sentence of Section 7.22(D), the Prototype Document Sponsor and not the Custodian is responsible for choosing to make such investments available for investment and for determining the fair market value of each such investment, and the Custodian has determined only that it is functionally and operationally willing and able to provide its services hereunder with respect thereto. The Investment Fiduciary will be responsible for ensuring compliance with all conditions, limitations, and restrictions concerning investment in any invest-ment option. The Custodian shall place monies or other property received by it in such permitted investments as the Custodian will be directed from time to time by instructions of the Investment Fiduciary (or Participant, if applicable) provided to it. If Participant direction in Plan Section 7.22(B) has been selected, the investment instructions of the Participants will be aggregated and delivered to the Custodian by the Plan Administrator or its agent. In the absence of Participant direction, the investment instructions of the appropri-ate Investment Fiduciary will be delivered to the Custodian by the Plan Administrator or its agent. The Custodian may hold the assets attributable to the Fund in omnibus accounts with assets of other retirement plans for which the Custodian serves as custodian or trustee. Nothing herein will preclude the Investment Fiduciary from otherwise investing any Plan assets as permitted by the Plan, but the Custodian will not be Custodian or Trustee thereof or have any duties or responsibilities with respect thereto.6. The Custodian is not obligated to place orders for the investment of the Fund if sufﬁ cient cash is not available in the Fund for use in placing such orders. The Custodian is authorized, but is not obli-gated, to advance funds or to arrange for another ﬁ nancial organiza-tion (which may be an afﬁ liate of the Custodian) to advance funds from time to time for the purchase of investment assets, for distribu-tions from the Fund and for other purposes before receipt of suf-ﬁ cient funds (whether contributions or proceeds of the liquidation of other investments). All such advances will be made subject to the requirements of ERISA and the rules, regulations, rulings, and inter-pretations thereunder, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 80-26, as amended from time to time. If sufﬁ cient funds to repay any such advance are not received by the following business day, the Custodian may, in its discretion, then or at any time thereafter before such repayment, sell, redeem, or otherwise liquidate any assets of the Fund in order to repay such advance. Any gain realized upon such liquidation, after payment of any related costs and expenses, will belong to the Plan. The Employer shall reimburse the Custodian on demand for any portion of any such advance and the related costs and expenses not repaid from the proceeds of the liquidation.7. The Custodian shall keep such portion of the Fund in cash or cash balances as may be directed from time to time by the applicable Investment Fiduciary. The Custodian will not be liable for any interest on any cash balances so maintained nor for interest on any cash or cash balances maintained in the Fund pending investment in accor-dance with appropriate directions. Monies being transferred to and disbursed by the Custodian may be held in non-interest bearing transaction accounts in ﬁ nancial organizations selected by the Custodian (which may be afﬁ liates of the Custodian) for purposes of collections and processing transfers and disbursements. The Custodian may transfer monies from the Fund to such accounts before issuance of wire transfer orders or checks, drafts, or other instruments payable from such accounts. The Custodian will not exercise its powers in Plan Section 8.01(B)(1) except pursuant to the instructions of the Investment Fiduciary transmitted to the Custodian.8. Should the Investment Fiduciary instruct the Custodian to use the services of any broker, dealer, employee, or representative of either, or any other person (“Broker”) to render services to the Fund, or should the Custodian require the services of such persons in order to fulﬁ ll its obligations pursuant to the Plan, the applicable Investment Fiduciary will be solely responsible for the selection or \fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1232-33 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The Custodian shall fully comply with the writ-ten instructions, if of a continuing nature, until revoked.9. In connection with payments and disbursements made from the Fund for any purpose, the Custodian shall be responsible for issuing checks or drafts to such parties and for such amounts as the Plan Administrator will instruct. The Custodian will be fully protected in making such payments pursuant to such instructions from time to time and will be charged with no responsibility whatsoever respect-ing the purposes or propriety of such payments or the application of such monies.10. The Custodian shall provide any materials received by it relating to voting securities to the applicable Investment Fiduciary, which will be responsible for voting securities or arranging for such securities to be voted in accordance with the Plan and applicable law. It is understood that the Custodian will exercise the powers described in Plan Section 8.01(B) only pursuant to instructions of the Investment Fiduciary transmitted to the Custodian.11. The Custodian shall determine or have determined the value of the Fund as of each Valuation Date. The Custodian shall rely exclu-sively upon, and will not be responsible for, share and unit values established by third parties, or unit values established by the Custodian in its capacity as a mutual fund recordkeeper, transfer agent, or Custodian to the extent that the Custodian establishes such unit values in reliance on third-party information, including, but not limited to:a. in connection with mutual funds, the net asset value reported to the Custodian by such mutual funds or the transfer or other agents of such mutual funds or any generally recognized pricing service;b. in connection with bank collective funds, the unit value as reported by the trustee of such funds or its agent;c. in connection with policies and contracts with insurance companies or other ﬁ nancial institutions, the book value or other value ascribed to such policies or contracts by the insurance company or its agent or other ﬁ nancial organization or its agent; andd. in connection with publicly traded securities, the market price of such securities as reported to the public in a generally available form. The Custodian will have no liability from the failure or delay of any pricing source to provide a valuation as of any Valuation Date. If values for any investment of the Fund are not generally available, the Custodian shall rely upon instructions provided to it by the applicable Investment Fiduciary as to valuation procedures. With respect to the portion of the Fund that is invested by an investment manager or other named ﬁ duciary, the Custodian may conclusively rely upon the value of any securities or other property in that portion of the custo-dial account as reported to the Custodian by the investment man-ager or other named ﬁ duciary, for all purposes hereunder. 12. All records maintained by the Custodian with respect to the Fund will be held for such period as may be required under applicable law. Upon the expiration of any such required retention period, the Custodian will have the right to destroy such records. The Custodian will have the right to preserve all records and accounts in original form, electronically, or on microﬁ lm, magnetic tape, or any other similar process pursuant to applicable federal law and subsequent rules promulgated by the IRS or DOL.13. Except as provided below, the Custodian will conclusively presume that the Employer, Trustee, Plan Administrator, or other responsible party has made all ﬁ lings required by law as of the date required. Should the Custodian incur any liability by reason of any party’s failure to timely ﬁ le, the Employer shall indemnify and hold the Custodian, any parent, subsidiary, related corporation, or afﬁ liate of the Custodian, including their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employees, and agents harmless for any and all liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees), and other obligations, including penalties and interest, incurred by the Custodian. Notwithstanding the provisions of Plan Section 5.11, in connection with the disbursement of assets from the Fund to a Participant, the Custodian shall withhold and remit to the IRS and other applicable taxing authorities the amount of any income tax withholding required by law pursuant to instructions provided by the Plan Administrator.14. Except for the disbursement of loan proceeds and reinvestment of loan payments pursuant to instructions received hereunder, under no circumstances will the Custodian have or be allocated any responsibility for the administration of any Participant loan program in Plan Section 5.14.B. Powers of the Custodian—Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, and subject to receipt of instructions from the Adopting Employer, Plan Administrator, or Investment Fiduciary, as appropriate, the Custodian will have the power, but, in the absence of proper direction as provided in Plan Section 8.01(A) above, not the duty to take any action with respect to the Fund which it deems necessary or advisable to discharge its responsibili-ties under this Plan including, but not limited to, the following powers.1. To invest all or a portion of the Fund (including idle cash balances) in time deposits, savings accounts, money market accounts, or similar investments bearing a reasonable rate of interest in the Custodian’s own savings department or the savings department of another ﬁ nancial organization;2. To vote upon any stocks, bonds, or other securities; to give general or special proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to exercise any conversion privileges or subscription rights and to make any payments incidental thereto; to oppose, or to consent to, or otherwise participate in, corporate reorganizations or other changes affecting corporate securities, and to pay any assessment or charges in connection therewith; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, securities, or other property;3. To hold securities or other property of the Fund in its own name, in the name of its nominee (as allowed under Department of Labor Regulation section 2550.403a-1(b)), or in bearer form; and4. To make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all documents of transfer and conveyance and any and all other instruments that may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the powers herein granted.8.02 TrusteeThis Plan Section 8.02 applies when either a ﬁ nancial organization has and/or one or more individuals have, indicated in the Adoption Agreement that it will serve as Trustee with respect to all or a portion of the assets of the Fund. The responsibilities and powers of the Trustee may not be expanded except with its prior written consent and, notwith-standing any provision hereof to the contrary, may be further limited by the terms of a separate agreement between the Trustee and the Adopting Employer. Notwithstanding any provision hereof regarding the responsibilities of or granting powers to the Trustee, a Directed Trustee will have no discretionary authority with respect to the management or administration of the Plan or the Fund, and is subject to the proper and lawful directions of the Plan Administrator, who has authority with respect to receipt of the Plan’s assets. A. Responsibilities of the Trustee—The responsibilities of the Trustee will be limited to the following duties.1. To receive Plan contributions and to hold, invest, and reinvest the portion of the Fund for which it serves as Trustee, as authorized by the Employer or its designee, without distinction between principal and interest; provided, however, that nothing in this Plan will require the Trustee to maintain physical custody of stock certiﬁ cates (or other indicia of ownership) representing assets within the Fund;2.

Generally to do all such acts, execute all such instruments, initiate such proceedings, and exercise all such rights and privileges with relation to property constituting the Fund as if the Trustee were the absolute owner thereof, and, to the extent not inconsistent with the express provisions hereof, the enumeration of any power herein will not be by way of limitation, but will be cumulative and construed as full and complete power in favor of the Trustee. In addition to the authority speciﬁ cally herein granted, the Trustee will have such power to do all acts as may be deemed necessary for full and complete management of the Fund and appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Fund, and will further have all powers and authorities conferred on trustees by the laws of the Trustee’s domiciliary state. 8.03 Compensation and ExpensesThe Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will receive such reasonable compensation as may be agreed upon by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and the Adopting Employer. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be entitled to reimbursement by the Employer for all proper expenses incurred in carrying out their duties under this Plan, including reasonable legal, accounting, and actuarial expenses. Such compensation will include any earnings on funds retained pursuant to Plan Sections 8.01(A)(7) and 8.02(B)(19) hereof in non-interest bearing accounts and any such earnings will not become a part of the Fund. The Adopting Employer expressly acknowledges that the ability of the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, and any afﬁ liated ﬁ nancial organization of the preceding, to earn income on amounts held in such non-interest bearing accounts has been taken into consideration in establishing the Trustee’s or Custodian’s fees hereunder. If not paid by the Employer, all such compensation and expenses may be charged against the Fund. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Participant will not be entitled to compensation even if they serve in the capacity as a Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be reimbursed by the Employer or from the Fund for all taxes of any kind whatsoever that may be levied or assessed under existing or future laws of any jurisdiction upon or in respect of the Fund. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) shall promptly notify the Employer with regard to any levies or tax assessments that it receives on any income or property maintained in the Fund and, unless notiﬁ ed to the contrary by the Employer within ninety (90) days, shall pay any such levies or assessments. If the Employer notiﬁ es the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) within said period that it is its opinion or the opinion of counsel that such levies or assessments are invalid or that they should be contested, then the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) shall take whatever action concern-ing payment of the levy or assessment as is indicated in the notice received by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable); provided, however, that the Employer, and not the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), will be responsible for contesting any such levies or assessments or litigat-ing any such claims.8.04 No Obligation to Question DataThe Employer shall furnish the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and Plan Administrator the information which each party deems necessary for the administration of the Plan including, but not limited to, changes in a Participant’s status, eligibility, mailing addresses and other such data as may be required. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and Plan Administrator will be entitled to act on such information as is supplied to them and will have no duty or responsibility to further verify or question such information.8.05 ResignationAny person serving as Trustee or Custodian may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Adopting Employer. The resignation will become effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice unless a shorter period is agreed upon. If the Adopting Employer fails to appoint a successor Trustee or Custodian following notice of resignation, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will have the power to appoint a successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).The Adopting Employer may remove any Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-cable) at any time by giving written notice to such Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and such removal will be effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice unless a shorter period is agreed upon. The Adopting Employer will have the power to appoint a successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). In the event the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) is removed, resigns, dies, or becomes incapacitated and the Adopting Employer or Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not or cannot appoint a succes-sor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) within a reasonable period of time thereafter, a majority of Participants in the Plan will have the authority to appoint a successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) but will not be obligated to do so if engaging a majority of Participants would result in unreasonable time, expense, or administrative burden.

If the Funds as reserved are not sufﬁ cient for such purpose, then they will be entitled to reimbursement from the successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) out of the assets in the successor Trustee’s (or Custodian’s, if applicable) hands under this Plan. If the amount reserved will be in excess of the amount actually needed, the former Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will return such excess to the successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).Upon receipt of the transferred assets, the successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will thereupon succeed to all of the powers and responsibilities given to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) by this Plan.Where a ﬁ nancial organization is serving as Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and it is merged with or bought by another organization (or comes under the control of any federal or state agency), that organiza-tion shall serve as the successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) of this Plan, but only if it is the type of organization that can so serve under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or any subsequent assignees may, by prior written notice to the Employer, and without the need for the Employer’s consent or prior approval, assign all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Plan to any afﬁ liate (which term includes, without limitation, any parent, subsidiary, or sister entity) of the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or the assignee.Where the Trustee or Custodian is serving as a nonbank trustee or custo-dian pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.408-2(e), the Adopting Employer will appoint a successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) upon notiﬁ cation by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that such Section 1\fItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1236-37 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Any instruc-tions hereunder may be delivered to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) directly by the responsible party or by other mutually agreed upon parties. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in reliance upon any instructions received hereunder or any other notice, request, consent, certiﬁ cate, or other instrument or paper reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been properly executed. A Directed Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will have no duty to inquire into the purpose or propriety of any order, instruction, or other communication received hereunder and may conclusively presume that any such order, instruc-tion, or other communication is accurate and complete. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not be responsible for determining that all instructions provided to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) are being given by the appropriate party and are in proper form under the provisions of the Plan and applicable law. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) may conclusively presume that any instructions received have been duly authorized by the Employer, Investment Fiduciary, Plan Administrator, Trustee, or Participant, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and applicable law. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not be responsible for the validity or effect or the qualiﬁ cation under the Code or the Plan.

Further, it is speciﬁ cally understood that the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will have no duty or responsibility with respect to the deter-mination of matters pertaining to the eligibility of any Employee to become a Participant or remain a Participant hereunder, the amount of beneﬁ t to which a Participant or Beneﬁ ciary will be entitled to receive hereunder, whether a distribution to Participant or Beneﬁ ciary is appro-priate under the terms of the Plan, the size and type of any policy to be purchased from any insurer for any Participant hereunder, or any other similar matters, it being understood that all such responsibilities under the Plan are vested in the Plan Administrator.8.07 Indemniﬁ cation of Trustee and CustodianNotwithstanding any provision hereof, the Adopting Employer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), and its afﬁ liates, and their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employees, agents, and other representatives harmless from any losses, costs, expenses, fees, liabilities, damages, claims, suits, or actions and appeals thereof resulting from their reliance upon any certiﬁ cate, notice, conﬁ rmation, or instruction purporting to have been delivered by a representative of the Adopting Employer or the Plan that has been duly identiﬁ ed to the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable) in a manner required or accepted by such Trustee (or Custodian, as appli-cable) (“Designated Representative”). The Adopting Employer waives any and all claims of any nature it now has or may have against the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable) and its afﬁ liates, and their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employees, agents, and other representa-tives, which arise, directly or indirectly, from any action that it takes in good faith in accordance with any certiﬁ cate, notice, conﬁ rmation, or instruction from a Designated Representative of the Adopting Employer. The Adopting Employer also hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), and any parent, subsid-iary, related corporation, or afﬁ liates of the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), including their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employees, agents, and other representatives, harmless from and against any and all loss, costs, damages, liability, expenses, or claims of any nature whatsoever, including but not limited to legal expenses, court costs, legal fees, and costs of investigation, including appeals thereof, arising, directly or indirectly, out of any loss or diminution of the Fund resulting from changes in the market value of the Fund assets; reliance, or action taken in reliance, on instructions from the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; any exercise or failure to exercise investment direction authority by the Adopting Employer or by its Designated Representative; the Trustee’s or Custodian’s refusal on advice of counsel to act in accordance with any investment direction by the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; any other act or failure to act by the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; any prohibited transaction or plan disqualiﬁ cation of a Qualiﬁ ed Plan due to any actions taken or not taken by the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), in reliance on instructions from the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; or any other act the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), takes in good faith hereunder that arises under the Plan or the administration of the Fund. The Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), will not be liable to the Adopting Employer for any act, omission, or determination made in connection with this Agreement except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the preceding, the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable) will not be liable for any losses arising from its compliance with instructions from the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; for executing, failing to execute, failing to timely execute, or for any mistake in the execution of any instructions, unless such action or inaction is by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable). The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be accountable only for monies or property actually received by it. If any portion of the Fund is held by another custodian or trustee, the term “Fund” herein will mean only that portion of the Fund from time to time held by the applicable Trustee or Custodian. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not be deemed accountable, responsible, or liable for the acts or omissions of any other custodian or trustee of the Plan. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will have no duty or responsibility for the determination of the accuracy or sufﬁ ciency of the contributions to be made under the Plan, the collection thereof, the transmittal of the same to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), or compliance with any statute, regulation, or rule applicable to such contributions. A Directed Trustee (or a Custodian, if applicable) will have no discretion as to investment of the Fund or administration of the Plan and will not be deemed a “ﬁ duciary” as that term is used in ERISA. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) is signing the Adoption Agreement solely to signify its acceptance of appointment as Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and the Employer will have sole responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, legal sufﬁ ciency, and due execution thereof, including consulting with legal counsel and tax advi-sors as the Employer deems appropriate in connection therewith.The provisions of this Plan Section 8.07 will survive the termination or amendment of the Plan. 8.08 MiscellaneousA.

Necessary Parties—To the extent permitted by law, only the Employer and the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be necessary parties in any application to the courts for an interpretation of Plan Sections 8.01 or 8.02 or for an accounting by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), and no other Plan Fiduciary, Participant, Beneﬁ ciary, or other person having an interest in the Fund will be entitled to any notice or service of process.

Agents—In performing its obligations under this Plan, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be entitled to employ suitable agents, counsel, sub-custodians, and other service providers.8.09 Limited TrusteeThis section applies where either a ﬁ nancial organization and/or one or more individuals has/have indicated in the Adoption Agreement that it will serve as Limited Trustee with respect to the Fund or where one or more individuals has/have indicated in the Adoption Agreement that they will serve as individual trustee(s) and a separate Limited Trustee(s) has not been indicated on the Adoption Agreement. At no time will a ﬁ nancial organization that is serving as a Trustee be considered a Limited Trustee without their express authorization shown by its signa-ture on either the Adoption Agreement or a separate form approved by the ﬁ nancial organization. The responsibilities and powers of the Limited Trustee may not be expanded except with its prior written consent and, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, may be further limited by the terms of a separate agreement between the Limited Trustee and the Adopting Employer. A. Responsibilities of the Limited TrusteeNotwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the responsibilities of the Limited Trustee will be limited to ensuring the timely collection and deposit of Employer Contributions.B. Compensation and ExpensesThe Limited Trustee will receive such reasonable compensation as may be agreed upon by the Limited Trustee and the Adopting Employer. The Limited Trustee will be entitled to reimbursement by the Employer for all proper expenses incurred in carrying out their duties under this Plan, including reasonable legal, accounting, and actuarial expenses. If not paid by the Employer, all such compensation and expenses may be charged against the Fund. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Participant will not be entitled to compensation even if they serve in the capacity as a Limited Trustee.C. No Obligation to Question DataThe Plan Administrator and/or Employer shall furnish to the Limited Trustee the information that the Limited Trustee deems necessary for complying with its responsibilities under the Plan. The Limited Trustee will be entitled to act on such information as is supplied and will have no duty or responsibility to further verify or question such information.D. ResignationAny person serving as Limited Trustee may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Adopting Employer. The resignation will become effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice unless a shorter period is agreed upon. The Adopting Employer may remove any Limited Trustee at any time by giving written notice to such Limited Trustee and such removal will be effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice unless a shorter period is agreed upon. The Adopting Employer will have the power and the duty to appoint a succes-sor Limited Trustee. If the Adopting Employer fails to appoint a succes-sor Limited Trustee following notice of resignation, the Trustee will have the power, but not the duty, to appoint a successor Limited Trustee. In no event will the Trustee become a Limited Trustee unless the Trustee acknowledges the appointment by executing the Limited Trustee section of the Adoption Agreement.Where a ﬁ nancial organization is serving as Limited Trustee and it is merged with or bought by another organization (or comes under the control of any federal or state agency), that organization will serve as the successor Limited Trustee of this Plan, but only if it is the type of organization that can so serve under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Limited Trustee or any subsequent assignees may, by prior written notice to the Employer, and without the need for the Employer’s consent or prior approval, assign all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Plan to any afﬁ liate (which term includes, without limitation, any parent, subsidiary, or sister entity) of the Limited Trustee or the assignee.E. Degree of Care—Limitations of LiabilityThe Limited Trustee will be under no duty to take any action other than its express responsibilities under this Plan unless the responsible party under the terms of the Plan shall furnish the Limited Trustee with writ-ten instructions; provided that in no event may the Limited Trustee’s responsibilities be expanded except with its prior written consent. Any instructions hereunder may be delivered to the Limited Trustee directly by the responsible party or by other mutually agreed upon parties. The Limited Trustee will not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in reliance upon any instructions received hereunder or any other notice, request, consent, certiﬁ cate, or other instrument or paper reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been properly exe-cuted. The Limited Trustee will not be responsible for determining that all instructions provided to the Limited Trustee are being given by the appropriate party and are in proper form under the provisions of the Plan and applicable law. The Limited Trustee may conclusively presume that any instructions received have been duly authorized by the Employer, Plan Administrator, or Discretionary Trustee, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and applicable law. The Limited Trustee will not be responsible for the validity or effect or the qualiﬁ ca-tion under the Code or the Plan. F. Indemniﬁ cation of Limited TrusteeNotwithstanding any provision hereof, the Adopting Employer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Limited Trustee, and its afﬁ liates, and their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employees, agents, and other representatives harmless from any losses, costs, expenses, fees, liabilities, damages, claims, suits, or actions and appeals thereof resulting from their reliance upon any certiﬁ cate, notice, conﬁ rmation, or instruction purporting to have been delivered by a representative of the Adopting Employer or the Plan that has been duly identiﬁ ed to the Limited Trustee in a manner required or accepted by such Limited Trustee. The Adopting Employer waives any and all claims of any nature it now has or may have against the Limited Trustee and its afﬁ liates, and their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employ-ees, agents, and other representatives, which arise, directly or indi-rectly, from any action or act the Limited Trustee takes in good faith hereunder that arises under the Plan or the administration of the Fund.

This opinion relates only to the acceptability of the form of the plan under the Internal Revenue Code. It is not an opinion of the effect of other Federal or local statutes.You must furnish a copy of this letter, a copy of the approved plan, and copies of any subsequent amendments to each employer who adopts this plan. Effective on or after 10/31/2011, interim amendments adopted by the sponsor on behalf of employers must provide the date of adoption by the sponsor.This letter considers the changes in qualiﬁ cation requirements contained in the 2010 Cumulative List of Notice 2010-90, 2010-52 I.R.B. 909.Our opinion on the acceptability of the form of the plan is not a ruling or determination as to whether an employer’s plan qualiﬁ es under Code section 401(a). The employer can generally rely on the letter as described in Rev. Proc. 2011-49, 2011-44 I.R.B. 608, provided the terms of the plan are followed in operation.Our opinion does not apply for purposes of Code section 401(a)(10)(B) and section 401(a)(16) if an employer ever maintained another qualiﬁ ed plan for one or more employees who are covered by this plan. For this purpose, the employer will not be considered to have maintained another plan merely because the employer has maintained another deﬁ ned contribution plan(s), provided such other plan(s) has been terminated prior to the effective date of this plan and no annual additions have been credited to the account of any participant under such other plan(s) as of any date within the limitation year of this plan. Also, for this purpose, an employer is considered as maintaining another plan, to the extent that the employer maintains a welfare beneﬁ t fund deﬁ ned in Code section 419(e), which provides postretirement medical beneﬁ ts allocated to separate accounts for key employees as deﬁ ned in Code section 419A(d)(3), or an individual medical account as deﬁ ned in Code section 415(l)(2), which is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the employer, or a simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan.An employer that adopts this plan may not rely on this opinion letter with respect to: (1) whether any amendment or series of amendments to the plan satisﬁ es the nondiscrimination requirements of section 1.401(a)(4)-5(a) of the regulations, except with respect to plan amendments granting past service that meet Letter 433327Section 2\fItem #REG47331-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-152 of 2Spellcheck: YesColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 2:34 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

L. 104-199, 110 Stat. 2419 (DOMA) or U.S. v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 12 (2013), which invalidated that section.The employer may request a determination (1) as to whether the plan, considered with all related qualiﬁ ed plans and, if appropriate, welfare beneﬁ t funds, individual medical beneﬁ t accounts, and simpliﬁ ed employee pension plans, satisﬁ es the requirements of Code section 401(a)(16) as to limitations on beneﬁ ts and contributions in Code section 415 and the requirements of Code section 401(a)(10)(B) as to the top-heavy plan requirements in Code section 416; (2) with respect to whether a money purchase or target beneﬁ t plan’s normal retirement age which is earlier than age 62 satisﬁ es the requirements of section 401(a)-1(b)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations; (3) that the plan is a multiple employer plan; (4) whether there has been a partial termination; and (5) to comply with published procedures of the Service (e.g. minimum funding waiver request). The employer may request a determination letter in these circumstances by ﬁ ling an application with Employee Plans Determinations on Form 5300, without restating for the Cumulative List in effect when the application is ﬁ led.If you, the master or prototype sponsor, have any questions concerning the IRS processing of this case, please call the above telephone number.

For purposes of calculating the ADP, Employer Contributions on behalf of any Participant will include: 1) any Elective Deferrals (other than Catch-up Contributions) made pursuant to the Participant’s salary deferral election or pursuant to automatic Elective Deferral enrollment, if applicable (including Excess Elective Deferrals of Highly Compensated Employees), but excluding Excess Elective Deferrals of Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees that arise solely from Elective Deferrals made under the Plan or plans of this Employer.

Catch-up ContributionsMeans Elective Deferrals made pursuant to Plan Section Three that are in excess of an otherwise applicable Plan limit and that are made by Participants who are age 50 or older by the end of their taxable year. An otherwise applicable Plan limit is a limit in the Plan that applies to Elective Deferrals without regard to Catch-up Contributions, such as the limits on Annual Additions, the dollar limitation on Elective Deferrals under Code section 402(g) (not counting Catch-up Contributions), the limit imposed by the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) test under Code section 401(k)(3), or any other allowable limit imposed by the Employer. Catch-up Contributions for a Participant for a taxable year may not exceed (1) the dollar limit on Catch-up Contributions under Code section 414(v)(2)(B)(i) for the taxable year or (2) when added to other Elective Deferrals, an amount that would enable the Employer to satisfy other statutory or regulatory requirements (e.g., income tax withholding, FICA and FUTA withholding).

After 2006, the $5,000 limit will be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living increases under Code section 414(v)(2)(C). Any such adjustments will be in multiples of $500. CodeMeans the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended from time to time. CompensationA. General Deﬁ nition—The following deﬁ nition of Compensation will apply. W-2 wages. Compensation is deﬁ ned as information required to be reported under Code sections 6041, 6051, and 6052 (wages, tips, and other compensation as reported on Form W-2). Compensation is further deﬁ ned as wages within the meaning of Code section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an Employee by the Employer (in the course of the Employer’s trade or business) for which the Employer is required to furnish the Employee a written statement under Code sec-tions 6041(d), 6051(a)(3), and 6052. Compensation must be determined without regard to any rules in Code section 3401(a) that limit the remu-neration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employ-ment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code section 3401(a)(2)). For any Self-Employed Individual covered under the Plan, Compensation will mean Earned Income. B. Determination Period And Other Rules—Where an Employee becomes an eligible Participant on any date subsequent to the ﬁ rst day of the applicable Determination Period, Compensation shall include that Compensation paid to the Employee during the entire Determination Period, unless otherwise required by either the Code or ERISA. Compensation received by an Employee during a Determination Period in which the Employee does not perform services for the Employer will be disregarded.Compensation will include any amount that is contributed by the Employer pursuant to a salary reduction agreement and that is not includible in the gross income of the Employee under Code sections 125, 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), or 403(b).

Compensation paid or made available during such Limitation Year will include any elective deferral (as deﬁ ned in Code section 402(g)(3)) and any amount that is contributed or deferred by the Employer at the elec-tion of the Employee and that is not includible in the gross income of the Employee by reason of Code sections 125, 132(f), or 457. Payments made after Severance from Employment will be included in Compensation within the meaning of Compensation as described in Part A of the deﬁ nition of Compensation in the Plan’s Deﬁ nition section, if they meet the following requirements:1. Payments described in paragraphs (2), (3), or (4) below will be included in the deﬁ nition of Compensation (within the meaning of Compensation as described in Part A of this deﬁ nition of Compensation) provided such payments meet the following requirements:a. Those amounts are paid by the later of 1) 2½ months after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan or 2) the end of the Limitation Year that includes the date of Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan; andb. Those amounts would have been included in the deﬁ nition of Compensation if they were paid before the Employee’s Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan. A governmental plan (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(d)) may provide for the substitution of the calendar year in which the Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan occurs for the Limitation Year in which the Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan occurs.2. Regular Pay. An amount is described in this paragraph (2) if a. The payment is regular compensation for services during the Employee’s regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the Employee’s regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar payments; andb. The payment would have been paid to the Employee prior to a Severance from Employment if the Employee had continued in employment with the Employer.3. Leave Cashouts. An amount is described in this paragraph (3) if a. The payment is for unused accrued bona ﬁ de sick, vacation, or other leave, but only if the Employee would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued.4. Deferred Compensation. An amount is described in this paragraph (4) if a. The payment is an amount received by an Employee pursuant to a nonqualiﬁ ed unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid to the Employee at the same time if the Employee had continued in employment with the Employer and only to the extent that the payment is includible in the Employee’s gross income.5. Other post-severance payments. Any payment that is not described in paragraph (2), (3), or (4) above is not considered Compensation under paragraph (1) above if paid after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan, even if it is paid within the time period described in paragraph (1) above. Thus, Compensation does not include severance pay, or parachute payments within the meaning of Code section 280G(b)(2), if they are paid after Severance from Employment with the Employer maintaining the Plan, and does not include post-severance payments under a nonqualiﬁ ed unfunded deferred compensation plan unless the payments would have been paid at that time without regard to the Severance from Employment. Any payments not described above are not considered Compensation if paid after Severance from Employment, even if they are paid within 2½ months following Severance from Employment, except for pay-ments to an individual who does not currently perform services for the Employer by reason of qualiﬁ ed military service (within the mean-ing of Code section 414(u)(1)) to the extent these payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the indi-vidual had continued to perform services for the Employer rather than entering qualiﬁ ed military service.C. Compensation for ADP and Code section 401(a)(4) Testing—Compensation for purposes of ADP and Code section 401(a)(4) testing will generally be W-2 wages unless another deﬁ nition is required by law or regulation. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Plan Administrator has the option from year to year to use a different deﬁ nition of Compensation for testing purposes provided the deﬁ nition of Compensation satisﬁ es Code section 414(s) and the corresponding regulations. D. Limits On Compensation—The annual Compensation of each Participant taken into account in determining allocations will not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code section 401(a)(17)(B). Annual Compensation means Compensation during the Plan Year or such other consecutive 12-month period over which Compensation is otherwise determined under the Plan (Determination Period). The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for the calendar year applies to annual Compensation for the Determination Period that begins with or within such calendar year.If a Determination Period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual Compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual Compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short Determination Period, and the denominator of which is 12.If Compensation for any prior Determination Period is taken into account in determining an Employee’s allocations or beneﬁ ts for the current Determination Period, the Compensation for such prior Determination Period is subject to the applicable annual Compensation limit in effect for that prior period.E. Elective Deferrals—Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the con-trary, with respect to Compensation that is paid (or would have been paid but for a cash or deferred election) in Plan Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, a Participant may only make Elective Deferrals from Compensation within the meaning of Compensation as described in Part A of this deﬁ nition of Compensation.F. Differential Wage Payments—Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, if the Employer chooses to provide Differential Wage Payments to individuals who are active duty members of the uniformed services, such individuals will be treated as Employees of the Employer making the Differential Wage Payment and the Differential Wage Payment will be treated as Compensation for purposes of applying the Code. Accordingly, Differential Wage Payments must be treated as Compensation as described in Part A of this deﬁ nition of Compensation. Differential Wage Payments will also be treated as Compensation for contribution, allocation, and other general Plan purposes, unless excluded from the Plan’s deﬁ nition of Compensation on the Adoption Agreement. In addition, the Plan will not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of any provision described in Code section 414(u)(1)(C) by reason of any contribution or beneﬁ t that is based on Differential Wage Payments only if all Employees of the Employer (as determined under Code sections 414(b), (c), (m), and (o)) performing service in the uniformed services described in Code section 3401(h)(2)(A) are entitled to receive Differential Wage Payments on reasonably equivalent terms and, if eligible to partici-pate in the Plan, to make contributions based on the payments on rea-sonably equivalent terms applying the provisions of Code section 410(b)(3), (4), and (5). Such contributions or beneﬁ ts may be taken into account for purposes of nondiscrimination testing as long as they do not cause the Plan to fail the nondiscrimination requirements.Contributing ParticipantMeans a Participant who has enrolled as a Contributing Participant pursu-ant to Plan Section 3.01 and on whose behalf the Employer is contribut-ing Elective Deferrals to the Plan.CustodianMeans an entity appointed in the Adoption Agreement (or, if applicable, in a separate custodial agreement) by the Adopting Employer to hold the \\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-124-5 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Elective Deferrals will not include any defer-rals properly distributed as Excess Annual Additions. No Participant will be permitted to have Elective Deferrals made under this Plan, or any other qualiﬁ ed plan maintained by the Employer, during any taxable year of the Participant, in excess of the dollar limitation contained in Code section 402(g) in effect at the beginning of such taxable year. In the case of a Participant age 50 or over by the end of the taxable year, the dollar limitation described in the preceding sentence is increased by the amount of Elective Deferrals that can be Catch-up Contributions. The dollar limitation contained in Code section 402(g) is $10,500 for taxable years beginning in 2000 and 2001, increasing to $11,000 for taxable years beginning in 2002, and increasing by $1,000 for each year thereafter up to $15,000 for taxable years beginning in 2006 and later years.

Each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, is either awarded or agreed to by the Employer. The same Hours of Service will not be credited both under paragraph (1) or paragraph (2), as the case may be, and under this paragraph (3). These hours will be credited to the Employee for the computation period or peri-ods to which the award or agreement pertains rather than the com-putation period in which the award, agreement, or payment is made. 4. Solely for purposes of determining whether a Break in Eligibility Service has occurred in a computation period, an individual who is absent from work for maternity or paternity reasons will receive credit for the Hours of Service that would otherwise have been credited to such individual but for such absence, or in any case in which such hours cannot be determined, eight Hours of Service per day of such absence. For purposes of this paragraph, an absence from work for maternity or paternity reasons means an absence 1) by reason of the pregnancy of the individual, 2) by reason of a birth of a child of the individual, 3) by reason of the placement of a child with the individual in connection with the adoption of such child by such individual, or 4) for purposes of caring for such child for a period beginning immediately following such birth or placement. The Hours of Service credited under this paragraph will be credited 1) in the Eligibility Computation Period or Plan Year in which the absence begins if the crediting is necessary to prevent a Break in Eligibility Service in the applicable period, or 2) in all other cases, in the following Eligibility Computation Period or Plan Year. 5. Hours of Service will be credited for employment with other mem-bers of an afﬁ liated service group (under Code section 414(m)), a controlled group of corporations (under Code section 414(b)), or a group of trades or businesses under common control (under Code section 414(c)) of which the Adopting Employer is a member, and any other entity required to be aggregated with the Employer pursuant to Code section 414(o) and the corresponding regulations.  Hours of Service will also be credited for any individual considered an Employee for purposes of this Plan under Code sections 414(n) or 414(o) and the corresponding regulations. 6. Where the Employer maintains the plan of a predecessor employer, service for such predecessor employer will be treated as service for the Employer. If the Employer does not maintain the plan of a prede-cessor employer, service for such predecessor employer will not be treated as service for the Employer. Indirect RolloverMeans a rollover contribution received by this Plan from an Employee that previously received a distribution from this Plan or another plan rather than having such amount directly rolled over to this Plan from the distrib-uting plan.Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-128-9 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Exception for Certain Payments—A Domestic Relations Order will not be treated as failing to meet the requirements above solely because such order requires that payment of beneﬁ ts be made to an Alternate Payee1. on or after the date on which the Participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(p)(4)(B),2. as if the Participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order, and 3. in any form in which such beneﬁ ts may be paid under the Plan to the Participant (other than in a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity) with respect to the Alternate Payee and their subsequent spouse. Qualiﬁ ed Election Means a waiver of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or a Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity. Any waiver of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or a Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity will not be effective unless 1) the Participant’s Spouse consents to the election (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL), 2) the election designates a speciﬁ c Beneﬁ ciary, including any class of beneﬁ ciaries or any contingent beneﬁ ciaries, that may not be changed without spousal consent (or the Spouse expressly permits designations by the Participant without any further spousal con-sent), 3) the Spouse’s consent acknowledges the effect of the election, and d) the Spouse’s consent is witnessed by a Plan representative or notary public. Additionally, a Participant’s waiver of the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity will not be effective unless the election designates a form of beneﬁ t payment that may not be changed without spousal con-sent (or the Spouse expressly permits designations by the Participant without any further spousal consent). If it is established to the satisfac-tion of a Plan representative that there is no Spouse or that the Spouse cannot be located, a waiver by the Participant will be deemed a Qualiﬁ ed Election. In addition, if the Spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, the Spouse’s legal guardian, even if the guardian is the Participant, may give consent. If the Participant is legally separated or the Participant has been abandoned (within the meaning of local law) and the Participant has a court order to such effect, spousal consent is not required unless a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order provides otherwise. Any consent by a Spouse obtained under this provision (or establishment that the consent of a Spouse may not be obtained) will be effective only with respect to such Spouse. A consent that permits designations by the Participant without any requirement of further consent by such Spouse must acknowledge that the Spouse has the right to limit consent to a speciﬁ c Beneﬁ ciary, and a speciﬁ c form of beneﬁ t where applicable, and that the Spouse voluntarily elects to relinquish either or both of such rights. A revocation of a prior waiver may be made by a Participant with-out the consent of the Spouse at any time before the commencement of beneﬁ ts. The number of revocations will not be limited. No consent obtained under this provision will be valid unless the Participant has received notice as provided in Plan Section 5.10(D).Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity Means an immediate annuity for the life of the Participant with a survivor annuity for the life of the Spouse that is not less than 50 percent and not more than 100 percent of the amount of the annuity that is payable during the joint lives of the Participant and the Spouse and that is the amount of beneﬁ t that can be purchased with the Participant’s vested account balance. The percentage of the survivor annuity under the Plan will be 50 percent.Qualiﬁ ed Optional Survivor Annuity Means an annuity 1) for the life of the Participant with a survivor annuity for the life of the Spouse that is equal to the “applicable percentage” of the amount of the annuity that is payable during the joint lives of the Participant and the Spouse, and 2) that is the actuarial equivalent of a single annuity for the life of the Participant. If the survivor annuity pro-vided by the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is less than 75 percent of the annuity payable during the joint lives of the Participant and the Spouse, the applicable percentage is 75 percent. If the survivor annuity provided by the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is greater than or equal to 75 percent, the applicable percentage is 50 percent.Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor AnnuityMeans a survivor annuity for the life of the surviving Spouse of the Participant if the payments are not less than the amounts that would be payable as a survivor annuity under the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity under the Plan in accordance with Code section 417(c).

Employee Not a Participant Before Break—If an Employee incurs a Break in Eligibility Service before satisfying the Plan’s eligibility require-ments, such Employee’s eligibility service before such Break in Eligibility Service will not be taken into account. B. Employee a Participant Before Break—If a Participant incurs a Break in Eligibility Service, such Participant will continue to participate in the Plan, or, if terminated, will participate immediately following the date of reemployment. 2.05 Determinations Under This SectionThe Plan Administrator will determine the eligibility of each Employee to be a Participant. This determination will be conclusive and binding upon all persons except as otherwise provided herein or by law. 2.06 Terms of EmploymentNothing with respect to the establishment of the Plan and trust or any action taken with respect to the Plan, nor the fact that a common law Employee has become a Participant will give to that Employee any right to employment or continued employment or to grant any other rights except as speciﬁ cally set forth in this Plan document, ERISA, or other applicable law; nor will the Plan or trust limit the right of the Employer to discharge an Employee or to otherwise deal with an Employee with-out regard to the effect such treatment may have upon the Employee’s rights under the Plan. Section Three: Contributions3.01 Elective DeferralsEach Employee who satisﬁ es the eligibility requirements speciﬁ ed in the Adoption Agreement may begin making such Elective Deferrals to the Plan by enrolling as a Contributing Participant.A. Requirements to Enroll as a Contributing Participant—Each Employee who satisﬁ es the eligibility requirements speciﬁ ed in the Adoption Agreement, may enroll as a Contributing Participant, on the ﬁ rst Entry Date coinciding with or following the date the Employee satisﬁ es the eligibility requirements, or if applicable, the ﬁ rst Entry Date following the date on which the Employee returns to the eligible class of Employees pursuant to Plan Section 2.03. A Participant who wishes to enroll as a Contributing Participant must deliver (either in writing or in any other form permitted by the IRS and the DOL) a salary reduction agreement to the Plan Administrator. Except for occasional, bona ﬁ de administrative considerations as set forth in the Treasury Regulations, contributions made pursuant to such election cannot precede the earlier of 1) the date on which services relating to the contribution are performed, and 2) the date on which the Compensation that is subject to the election would be payable to the Employee in the absence of an election to defer. If a Plan permits both Pre-Tax and Roth Elective Deferrals and the Participant fails to designate whether their Elective Deferrals are Pre-Tax or Roth Elective Deferrals, the Participant will be deemed to have desig-nated the Elective Deferrals as Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals.The Employer shall deposit Elective Deferrals with the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) as of such time as is required by the IRS and DOL.B. Ceasing Elective Deferrals—A Participant may cease Elective Deferrals and thus withdraw as a Contributing Participant as of any such times established by the Plan Administrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner by revoking the authorization to the Employer to make Elective Deferrals on their behalf. A Participant who desires to withdraw as a Contributing Participant will give notice of withdrawal to the Plan Administrator at least 30 days (or such shorter period as the Plan Administrator will permit in a uniform and nondiscriminatory man-ner) before the effective date of withdrawal. A Participant will cease to be a Contributing Participant upon their Termination of Employment or on account of termination of the Plan. C. Return as a Contributing Participant After Ceasing Elective Deferrals—A Participant who has withdrawn as a Contributing Participant (e.g., pursuant to Plan Section 3.01(B), a suspension due to a hardship distribution, or a suspension due to a distribution on account of a Deemed Severance from Employment) may not again become a Contributing Participant such times established by the Plan Administrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.D. Changing Elective Deferral Amounts—A Contributing Participant or a Participant who has met the eligibility requirements in the Adoption Agreement, but who has never made an afﬁ rmative election regarding Elective Deferrals, may complete a new or modify an existing salary reduction agreement to increase or decrease the amount of their Compensation deferred into the Plan or change the type of their future Elective Deferrals (Roth or Pre-Tax), if applicable. Such modiﬁ cation may be made as of such times established by the Plan Administrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. A modiﬁ cation that results in the amount of the Participant’s Compensation being deferred into the Plan being zero (0) will be considered a cessation of deferrals under the Plan. A Contributing Participant who desires to make such a modiﬁ cation will complete and deliver (either in writing or in any other form permitted by the IRS and the DOL) a new salary reduction agreement. The Plan Administrator may prescribe such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules as it deems appropriate to carry out the terms of this Plan Section 3.01(D).E. Pre-Tax Vs. Roth Elective Deferrals—If the Adopting Employer so elects in the Adoption Agreement, each Employee who enrolls as a Contributing Participant may specify whether their Elective Deferrals are to be characterized as Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals, Roth Elective Deferrals, or a speciﬁ ed combination. A Contributing Participant’s election will remain in effect until superseded by another election. Elective Deferrals contributed to the Plan as one type, either Roth or Pre-Tax, may not later be reclassiﬁ ed as the other type. A Contributing Participant’s Roth Elective Deferrals will be deposited in the Contributing Participant’s Roth Elective Deferral subaccount in the Plan. No contributions other than Roth Elective Deferrals and properly attributable earnings will be credited to each Contributing Participant’s Roth Elective Deferral account, and gains, losses, and other credits or charges will be allocated on a reason-able and consistent basis to such subaccount.F. Catch-up Contributions—All Employees who are eligible to make Elective Deferrals under this Plan and who are age 50 or older by the end of their taxable year will be eligible to make Catch-up Contributions. Catch-up Contributions are not subject to the limits on Annual Additions under Code section 415, are not counted in the ADP test, and are not counted in determining the minimum allocation under Code section 416 (but Catch-up Contributions made in prior years are counted in determin-ing whether the Plan is top-heavy). Provisions in the Plan relating to Catch-up Contributions apply to Elective Deferrals made after 2001.3.02 Employer ContributionsA. Obligation to Contribute—The Employer may contribute an amount to be determined from year to year. The Employer may, in its sole discre-tion, make contributions without regard to current or accumulated earn-ings or proﬁ ts. B. Allocation Formula and the Right to Share in the Employer Contribution 1. General—Employer Proﬁ t Sharing Contributions will be allocated to all Qualifying Participants using a pro rata allocation formula. Under the pro rata allocation formula, Employer Proﬁ t Sharing Contributions will be allocated to the Individual Accounts of Qualifying Participants \\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1212-13 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The Employer Contribution for any Plan Year will be deemed allocated to each Participant’s Individual Account as of the last day of that Plan Year.  Any Employer Contribution for a Plan Year must satisfy Code sec-tion 401(a)(4) and the corresponding Treasury Regulations for such Plan Year.2. Special Rule for Owner-Employees—If this Plan provides contribu-tions or beneﬁ ts for one or more Owner-Employees, contributions on behalf of any Owner-Employee may be made only with respect to the Earned Income of such Owner-Employee.3. Inclusion of Ineligible Employees—If any Employee who is not a Qualifying Participant is erroneously treated as a Qualifying Participant during a Plan Year, then, except as otherwise provided in Plan Section 3.02(F), the Employer will not be eligible to receive any portion of the contribution erroneously allocated to the Individual Account of the ineligible Employee. The Employer must correct the inclusion of ineligible employees using any method permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) or allowed by the IRS or DOL under regulations or other guidance. EPCRS is currently described in IRS Revenue Procedure 2013-12.4. Exclusion of Eligible Participant—If in any Plan Year, any Participant is erroneously excluded and discovery of such exclusion is not made until after the Employer Contribution has been made and allocated, then the Employer must contribute for the excluded Participant the amount, including earnings thereon, that the Employer should have contributed for the Participant. The Employer must correct the exclu-sion of eligible Participants using any method permitted under EPCRS or allowed by the IRS or DOL under regulations or other guidance. EPCRS is currently described in IRS Revenue Procedure 2013-12.C. Allocation of Forfeitures—A Participant’s Individual Account shall be nonforfeitable and 100 percent vested at all times. D. Timing of Employer Contribution—Unless otherwise speciﬁ ed in the Plan or permitted by law or regulation, the Employer Contribution made by an Employer for each Plan Year will be deposited with the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) not later than the due date for ﬁ ling the Employer’s income tax return for its tax year in which the Plan Year ends, including extensions thereof. Notwithstanding the preceding, Employer Contributions may be deposited during the Plan Year for which they are being made.E. Minimum Allocation for Top-Heavy Plans—The contribution and allo-cation provisions of this Plan Section 3.02(E) will apply for any Plan Year with respect to which this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan and will super-sede any conﬂ icting provisions in the Plan. 1. Except as otherwise provided in (3) and (4) below, the Employer Contributions allocated on behalf of any Participant who is not a Key Employee will not be less than the lesser of three-percent of such Participant’s Compensation or (in the case where the Employer does not maintain a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan in addition to this Plan that desig-nates this Plan to satisfy Code section 401 the largest percentage of Employer Contributions, as a percentage of the Key Employee’s Compensation, as limited by Code section 401(a)(17), allocated on behalf of any Key Employee for that year. The minimum allocation is determined without regard to any Social Security contribution. Only Participants who are not Key Employees will be entitled to receive the minimum allocation. For purposes of the preceding sentences, the largest percentage of Employer Contributions as a percentage of each Key Employee’s Compensation will be determined by treating Elective Deferrals as Employer Contributions. This minimum allocation will be made even though under other Plan provisions, the Participant would not otherwise be entitled to receive an allocation.2. For purposes of computing the minimum allocation, Compensation will mean compensation as provided in the Deﬁ nitions Section of the Plan as limited by Code section 401(a)(17) and will include any amounts contributed by the Employer pursuant to a salary reduction agreement and that is not includible in gross income under Code sections 402(g), 125, 132(f)(4), or 457. Compensation for the full Determin-ation Year will be used in calculating the minimum allocation. 3. The provision in (1) above will not apply to any Participant who was not employed by the Employer on the last day of the Plan Year. 4. The minimum allocation required under this Plan Section 3.02(E) (to the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Code section 416(b)) may not be forfeited under Code sections 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D).5. Elective Deferrals (and for Plan Years beginning before 2002, Matching Contributions) may be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the minimum allocation requirement applicable to Top-Heavy Plans described in Plan Section 3.02(E)(1). F. Return of the Employer Contribution to the Employer Under Special Circumstances—Any contribution made by the Employer because of a mistake of fact must be returned to the Employer within one year of the contribution. In the event that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determines that the Plan is not initially qualiﬁ ed under the Code, any contributions made incident to that initial qualiﬁ cation by the Employer must be returned to the Employer within one year after the date the initial qualiﬁ cation is denied, but only if the application for qualiﬁ cation is made by the time prescribed by law for ﬁ ling the Employer’s return for the taxable year in which the Plan is adopted, or such later date as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe. In the event that a contribution made by the Employer under this Plan is conditioned on deductibility and is not deductible under Code section 404, the contribution, to the extent of the amount disallowed, must be returned to the Employer within one year after the deduction is disallowed. If applicable, no contract will be purchased under the Plan unless such contract or a separate deﬁ nite written agreement between the Employer and the insurer provides that no value under contracts providing ben-eﬁ ts under the Plan or credits determined by the insurer (on account of dividends, earnings, or other experience rating credits, or surrender or cancellation credits) with respect to such contracts may be paid or returned to the Employer or diverted to or used for other than the exclu-sive beneﬁ t of the Participants or their Beneﬁ ciaries. However, any contribution made by the Employer because of a mistake of fact must be returned to the Employer within one year of the contribution.3.03 Rollover ContributionsAn Employee may make Indirect Rollover and Direct Rollover contribu-tions to the Plan from distributions made from plans described in Code sections 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, and 457(b) (if maintained by a governmental entity) (excluding nondeductible employee contributions) unless an Employee is a member of any excluded class pursuant to Plan Section 2.01. The Plan Administrator may require the Employee to cer-tify, either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promul-gated by the IRS and DOL, that the contribution qualiﬁ es as a rollover contribution under the applicable provisions of the Code. If it is later determined that all or part of a rollover contribution was ineligible to be contributed to the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto (deter-mined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be distributed from the Plan to the Employee as soon as administratively feasible.A separate account will be maintained by the Plan Administrator for each Employee’s rollover contributions, which will be nonforfeitable at all times. Such account will share in the income and gains and losses of the Fund in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B). The Employer may, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, allow only Employees who have become Participants in the Plan to make rollover contributions. 2009 RMDs and Extended 2009 RMDs distributed for 2009 were con-sidered Eligible Rollover Distributions and could have been rolled over to the Plan in accordance with this section.Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1214-15 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Whether any particular elective transfer will be accepted by the Plan will be determined using the uniform and nondiscriminatory rules estab-lished by the Plan Administrator, and the procedures for the receipt of such transfers by the Plan must be allowed under Code section 411(d)(6), Treasury Regulation section 1.411(d)-4, and other rules promulgated by the IRS. Nothing in this Plan prohibits the Plan Administrator from permitting (or prohibiting) Participants to transfer their Individual Accounts to other eligible plans, provided such transfers are permitted (or prohibited) in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. If it is later determined that all or part of an elective transfer was ineligible to be transferred into the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto (deter-mined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be distributed from the Plan to the Employee as soon as administratively feasible. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may, at its discretion, also return the amount transferred to the transferor plan or correct the ineligible transfer using any other method permitted by the IRS under regulation or other guidance.A separate account will be maintained by the Plan Administrator for each Employee’s elective transfers, which will, if applicable, be nonforfeitable at all times. Such account will share in the income and gains and losses of the Fund in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B). If elective transfers are associated with distributable events and the Employees are eligible to receive single sum distributions con-sisting entirely of Eligible Rollover Contributions, the elective transfers will be considered Direct Rollovers.3.05 Limitation on AllocationsA. If the Participant does not participate in, and has never participated in, another qualiﬁ ed plan maintained by the Employer, a welfare beneﬁ t fund (as deﬁ ned in Code section 419(e)) maintained by the Employer, an individual medical account (as deﬁ ned in Code section 415(l)(2)) main-tained by the Employer, or a simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan (as deﬁ ned in Code section 408(k)) maintained by the Employer, any of which provides an Annual Addition as deﬁ ned in the Deﬁ nitions Section of the Plan, the following rules will apply. 1. The amount of Annual Additions that may be credited to the Participant’s Individual Account for any Limitation Year will not exceed the lesser of the Maximum Permissible Amount or any other limitation contained in this Plan. If the Employer Contribution that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant’s Individual Account would cause the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year to exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount, the amount contributed or allocated may be reduced so that the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year will equal the Maximum Permissible Amount. 2. Before determining the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year, the Employer may determine the Maximum Permissible Amount for a Participant on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the Participant’s Compensation for the Limitation Year, uniformly determined for all Participants similarly situated. 3. As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the Limitation Year, the Maximum Permissible Amount for the Limitation Year will be determined on the basis of the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year. 4. Any Excess Annual Additions allocated to a Participant may be cor-rected through EPCRS or such other correction method allowed by statute, regulations, or regulatory authorities. EPCRS is currently described in IRS Revenue Procedure 2013-12.B. If, in addition to this Plan, the Participant is covered under another qualiﬁ ed master or prototype deﬁ ned contribution plan maintained by the Employer, a welfare beneﬁ t fund maintained by the Employer, an individual medical account maintained by the Employer, or a simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan maintained by the Employer any of which pro-vides an Annual Addition as deﬁ ned in the Deﬁ nitions Section of the Plan during any Limitation Year, the following rules apply.1. The Annual Additions that may be credited to a Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan for any such Limitation Year will not exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount, reduced by the Annual Additions credited to a Participant under the other qualiﬁ ed Master or Prototype Plans, welfare beneﬁ t funds, individual medical account, and simpliﬁ ed employee pension plans for the same Limitation Year. If the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under other qualiﬁ ed Master or Prototype deﬁ ned contribution plans, welfare beneﬁ t funds, individual medical accounts, and simpliﬁ ed employee pension plans maintained by the Employer are less than the Maximum Permissible Amount, and the Employer Contribution that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan would cause the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year to exceed this limitation, the amount contrib-uted or allocated may be reduced so that the Annual Additions under all such plans and funds for the Limitation Year will equal the Maximum Permissible Amount. If the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under such other qualiﬁ ed Master or Prototype deﬁ ned contribution plans, welfare beneﬁ t funds, individual medical accounts, and simpliﬁ ed employee pension plans in the aggregate are equal to or greater than the Maximum Permissible Amount, no amount will be contributed or allocated to the Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan for the Limitation Year.2. Before determining the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year, the Employer may determine the Maximum Permissible Amount for a Participant in the manner described in Plan Section 3.05(A)(2).3. As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the Limitation Year, the Maximum Permissible Amount for the Limitation Year will be determined on the basis of the Participant’s actual Compensation for the Limitation Year.4. Any Excess Annual Additions attributed to this Plan will be disposed of in the manner described in Plan Section 3.05(A)(4).C. If the Participant is covered under another qualiﬁ ed deﬁ ned contri-bution plan maintained by the Employer, other than a Master or Prototype Plan, the provisions of Plan Section 3.05(B)(1) through 3.05(B)(4) will apply as if the other plan were a Master or Prototype Plan. In the event this method cannot be administered because of conﬂ icting language in the other plan, the Employer must provide, through a written attachment to the Plan, the method under which the plans will limit total Annual Additions to the Maximum Permissible Amount, and will properly reduce any Excess Annual Additions in a manner that precludes Employer discretion.3.06 Actual Deferral Percentage Test (ADP)A. Limits on Highly Compensated Employees—The Actual Deferral Percentage (hereinafter “ADP”) for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests.1. The ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year multi-plied by 1.25; or2. The ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year multiplied by 2.0 provided that the ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the ADP for Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees by more than two percentage points. The prior-year testing method described below will apply to this Plan. \\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1214-15 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Prior-Year Testing—The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the prior year’s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests.a. The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the prior year’s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 1.25; orb. The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the prior year’s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 2.0, provided that the ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees in the prior Plan Year by more than two percentage points. For the ﬁ rst Plan Year that the Plan permits any Participant to make Elective Deferrals and if this is not a successor Plan, for purposes of the preceding tests, the prior year’s non-Highly Compensated Employees’ ADP will be three-percent. B. Special Rules1. A Participant is a Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if they meet the deﬁ nition of a Highly Compensated Employee in effect for that Plan Year. Similarly, a Participant is a non-Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if they do not meet the deﬁ nition of a Highly Compensated Employee in effect for that Plan Year.2. The ADP for any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year and who is eligible to have Elective Deferrals allo-cated to their Individual Accounts under two or more arrangements described in Code section 401(k) that are maintained by the Employer, will be determined as if such Elective Deferrals were made under a single arrangement. If a Highly Compensated Employee participates in two or more cash or deferred arrangements that have different Plan Years, all Elective Deferrals made during the Plan Year under all such arrangements will be aggregated. For Plan Years beginning before 2006, cash or deferred arrangements ending with or within the same calendar year will be treated as a single arrange-ment. Notwithstanding the preceding, certain plans will be treated as separate if mandatorily disaggregated under the Treasury Regulations under Code section 401(k).3. In the event that this Plan satisﬁ es the requirements of Code sec-tions 401(k), 401(a)(4), or 410(b) only if aggregated with one or more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements of such Code sections only if aggregated with this Plan, then this Plan Section 3.06(B)(3) will be applied by determining the ADP of Participants as if all such plans were a single plan. If more than ten-percent of the Employer’s non-Highly Compensated Employees are involved in a plan coverage change as deﬁ ned in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-2(c)(4), then any adjustments to the non-Highly Compensated Employee ADP for the prior year will be made in accordance with such regulations. Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy Code section 401(k) only if they have the same Plan Year and use the same ADP testing method. 4. For purposes of satisfying the ADP test, Elective Deferrals must be made before the end of the 12-month period immediately following the Plan Year to which contributions relate.5. The Employer shall maintain records sufﬁ cient to demonstrate satis-faction of the ADP test.6. The determination and treatment of the ADP amounts of any Participant will satisfy such other requirements as may be pre-scribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.7. In the event that the Plan Administrator determines that it is not likely that the ADP test will be satisﬁ ed for a particular Plan Year unless certain steps are taken before the end of such Plan Year, the Plan Administrator may require Contributing Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees to reduce or cease future Elective Deferrals for such Plan Year in order to satisfy that requirement. This limitation will be considered a Plan-imposed limit for Catch-up Contribution purposes. If the Plan Administrator requires Contributing Participants to reduce or cease making Elective Deferrals under this paragraph, the reduction or cessation will begin with the Highly Compensated Employee with either the largest amount of Elective Deferrals or the highest Contribution Percentage for the Plan Year (on the date on which it is determined that the ADP test will not likely be satisﬁ ed), as elected by the Plan Administrator. All remaining Highly Compensated Employees’ Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year will be limited to such amount. Notwithstanding the preceding, if it is later determined that the ADP test for the Plan Year will be satisﬁ ed, Highly Compensated Employees will be permitted to enroll again as Contributing Participants in accordance with the terms of the Plan.8. Elective Deferrals that are treated as Catch-up Contributions because they exceed a Plan limit or a statutory limit will be excluded from ADP testing. Amounts which are characterized as Catch–up Contributions as a result of the ADP test will reduce the amount of Excess Contributions distributed.Section Four: Vesting and ForfeituresAn Employee is 100 percent vested in their Individual Account which shall be nonforfeitable at all times.Section Five: Distributions and Loans to Participants5.01 DistributionsA. Eligibility for Distributions1. Entitlement to Distribution—A Participant’s Individual Account shall be distributable to the Participant upon the Participant’s Termination of Employment, attainment of Normal Retirement Age, Disability, attainment of age 59½, or the termination of the Plan. If a Participant who is entitled to a distribution is not legally competent to request or consent to a distribution, the Participant’s court-appointed guardian, an attorney-in-fact acting under a valid power of attorney, or any other individual or entity authorized under state law to act on behalf of the Participant, may request and accept a distri-bution of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account under this Plan Section 5.01(A).2. Special Requirements for Certain 401(k) Contributions—Elective Deferrals and income allocable are not distributable to a Participant or their Beneﬁ ciary or Beneﬁ ciaries, in accordance with such Participant’s or Beneﬁ ciaries’ election, earlier than upon the Participant’s Severance from Employment, death, or Disability, except as listed below. Such amounts may also be distributed upon any one of the follow-ing events:a. termination of the Plan without the establishment of another deﬁ ned contribution plan, other than an employee stock ownership plan (as deﬁ ned in Code section 4975(e) or Code section 409), a simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan (as deﬁ ned in Code section 408(k)), a SIMPLE IRA Plan (as deﬁ ned in Code section 408(p)), a plan or contract described in Code section 403(b), or a plan described in Code section 457(b) or (f), at any time during the period beginning on the date of Plan termination and ending twelve months after all assets have been distributed from the Plan;b. attainment of age 59½ in the case of a proﬁ t sharing plan;c. existence of a hardship incurred by the Participant as described in Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(b); Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1216-17 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

If an individual receives a distribution due to a Deemed Severance from Employment, the individual may not make an Elective Deferral during the six-month period beginning on the date of the distribution; or e. a federally declared disaster as described in Plan Section 5.01(D)(3). All distributions that may be made pursuant to one or more of the preceding distribution eligibility requirements are subject to the spousal and Participant consent requirements (if applicable) con-tained in Code section 401(a)(11) and 417. In addition, distributions that are triggered by either a., b., or c. above must be made in a lump sum. For years beginning after 2005, if both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the year, the Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, may establish operational procedures, including ordering rules as permit-ted under the law and related regulations, that specify whether distributions, including corrective distributions of Excess Elective Deferrals, or Excess Annual Additions, will consist of a Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals, Roth Elective Deferrals, or a combination of both, to the extent such type of Elective Deferral was made for the year. The operational procedures may include an option for Participants to designate whether the distribution is being made from Pre-Tax or Roth Elective Deferrals.3. Distribution Request: When Distributed—A Participant or Beneﬁ ciary entitled to a distribution who wishes to receive a distribution must submit a request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator. If required in writing, such request will be made upon a form provided or approved by the Plan Administrator. Upon a valid request, the Plan Administrator will direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to commence distribution as soon as administratively feasible after the request is received. Distributions will be made based on the value of the Individual Account available at the time of actual distribution. To the extent the distribution request is for an amount greater than the Individual Account, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be entitled to distribute the entire Individual Account.B. Distributions Upon Termination of Employment1. Individual Account Balances Less Than or Equal to Cashout Level—If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account does not exceed the cashout level, the following rules will apply. If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account does not qualify as an Eligible Rollover Distribution, distribution from the Plan may be made to the Participant in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribu-tion under the Plan. If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account does not exceed $1,000 and qualiﬁ es as an Eligible Rollover Distribution, and the Participant does not elect to have such distribu-tion paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan speciﬁ ed by the Participant in a Direct Rollover or to receive the distribution in accor-dance with this Section Five of the Plan, distribution will be made to the Participant in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribution under the Plan. If the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $1,000 and qualiﬁ es as an Eligible Rollover Distribution, and if the Participant does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan speciﬁ ed by the Participant in a Direct Rollover or to receive the distribution in accordance with this Section Five of the Plan, distribu-tion will be paid by the Plan Administrator in a Direct Rollover to an individual retirement arrangement (as described in Code section 408(a), 408(b) or 408A) designated by the Plan Administrator.  Distributions made under this paragraph will occur following the Participant’s Termination of Employment in accordance with a uni-form and nondiscriminatory schedule established by the Plan Administrator. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Participant is reemployed by the Employer before the occurrence of the distribu-tion, no distribution will be made under this paragraph. The value of the Participant’s Individual Account for purposes of this paragraph will be determined by including rollover contributions (and earnings allocable thereto) within the meaning of Code sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3)(a)(ii), and 457(e)(16). 2. Individual Account Balances Exceeding Cashout Level—If distribution in the form of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is required with respect to a Participant and either the value of the Participant’s Vested Individual Account exceeds the cashout level or there are remaining payments to be made with respect to a particular distribu-tion option that previously commenced, and if the Individual Account is immediately distributable, the Participant must consent to any distribution of such Individual Account. If distribution in the form of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is not required with respect to a Participant and the value of such Participant’s Vested Individual Account exceeds the cashout level, and if the Individual Account is immediately distributable, the Participant must consent to any distribution of such Individual Account. The consent of the Participant and the Participant’s Spouse will be obtained (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) within the 180-day period ending on the Annuity Starting Date. The Plan Administrator shall notify the Participant and the Participant’s Spouse of the right to defer any distribution until the Participant’s Individual Account is no longer immediately distributable and, for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2006, the consequences of failing to defer any distri-bution. Such notiﬁ cation will include a general description of the material features, and an explanation of the relative values of the optional forms of beneﬁ t available under the Plan in a manner that would satisfy the notice requirements of Code section 417(a)(3), and a description of the consequences of failing to defer a distribution, and will be provided no less than 30 days and no more than 180 days before the Annuity Starting Date. If a distribution is one to which Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417 do not apply, such distribution may commence less than 30 days after the notice required in Treasury Regulation section 1.411(a)-11(c) is given, provided that:a. the Plan Administrator clearly informs the Participant that the Participant has a right to a period of at least 30 days after receiving the notice to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a distribution (and, if applicable, a particular distribution option), andb. the Participant, after receiving the notice, afﬁ rmatively elects a distribution. Notwithstanding the preceding, only the Participant need consent to the commencement of a distribution that is either made in the form of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or is made from a Plan that meets the Retirement Equity Act safe harbor rules of Plan Section 5.10(E), while the Individual Account is immediately distributable. Neither the consent of the Participant nor the Participant’s Spouse will be required to the extent that a distribution is required to satisfy Code section 401(a)(9) or Code section 415. In addition, upon termi-nation of this Plan, if the Plan does not offer an annuity option (purchased from a commercial provider), the Participant’s Individual Account may, without the Participant’s consent, be distributed to the Participant or transferred to another deﬁ ned contribution plan (other than an employee stock ownership plan as deﬁ ned in Code section 4975(e)(7)) within the same controlled group. An Individual Account is immediately distributable if any part of the Individual Account could be distributed to the Participant (or surviv-ing Spouse) before the Participant attains or would have attained (if not deceased) the later of Normal Retirement Age or age 62.3. Distribution Before Attainment of Normal Retirement Age—A Participant who has incurred a Termination of Employment before attaining Normal Retirement Age may elect to receive a distribution \\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1216-17 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

A Participant who has incurred a Severance from Employment before attaining Normal Retirement Age may elect to receive a distribution with regard to Elective Deferrals.C. Distributions During Employment1. In-Service Distributions—A Participant may elect to receive an in-service distribution of all or part of their Individual Account attribut-able to Employer Contributions, other than those described in Plan Sections 5.01(A)(2), upon meeting one of the following requirements. a. Participant for Five or More Years—An Employee who has been a Participant in the Plan for ﬁ ve or more years may withdraw up to the entire Individual Account.b. Participant for Less than Five Years—An Employee who has been a Participant in the Plan for less than ﬁ ve years may withdraw only the amount that has been in their Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions for at least two full Plan Years, measured from the date such contributions were allocated.  A Participant who is not otherwise eligible to receive a distribution of their Individual Account may elect to receive an in-service distribution of all or part of the Vested portion of their Individual Account attribut-able to transfers of money purchase pension contributions at age 62.  All in-service distributions are subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10, as applicable.2. Hardship Withdrawals a. Hardship Withdrawals of Employer Proﬁ t Sharing Contributions—Notwithstanding Plan Section 5.01(C)(1), an Employee may elect to receive a hardship distribution of all or part of the Vested portion of their Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions other than those described in Plan Section 5.01(A)(2), subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10.  For purposes of this Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(a), hardship is deﬁ ned as an immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need of the Employee where such Employee lacks other available resources. Financial needs considered immediate and heavy include, but are not limited to, 1) expenses incurred or necessary for medical care, described in Code section 213(d), of the Employee, the Employee’s Spouse, depen-dents, or the Employee’s Primary Beneﬁ ciary, 2) the purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal residence for the Employee, 3) payment of tuition and related educational fees for the next 12 months of post-secondary education for the Employee, the Employee’s spouse, children, dependents, or the Employee’s Primary Beneﬁ ciary, 4) payment to prevent the eviction of the Employee from, or a foreclosure on the mortgage of, the Employee’s principal residence, 5), funeral or burial expenses for the Employee’s deceased parent, Spouse, child, dependent, or the Employee’s Primary Beneﬁ ciary, and 6) payment to repair damage to the Employee’s principal residence that would qualify for a casualty loss deduction under Code section 165 (determined without regard to whether the loss exceeds ten-percent of adjusted gross income). A distribution will be considered necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need of the Employee only ifi. the Employee has obtained all distributions, other than hardship distributions, and all nontaxable loans available under all plans maintained by the Employer; andii. the distribution is not in excess of the amount of an immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need (including amounts necessary to pay any federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the distribution).b. Hardship Withdrawals of Elective Deferrals—Distribution of Elective Deferrals (including and any earnings credited to an Employee’s account as of the later of December 31, 1988, and the end of the last Plan Year ending before July 1, 1989) may be made to an Employee in the event of hardship. For the purposes of this Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(b), hardship is deﬁ ned as an immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need of the Employee where the distribution is needed to satisfy the immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need of such Employee. Hardship distributions are subject to the spousal consent require-ments contained in Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417, if applicable. For purposes of determining whether an Employee has a hardship, rules similar to those described in Plan Section 5.01(C)(2)(a) will apply except that only the ﬁ nancial needs listed above will be considered. In addition, a distribution will be considered as necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy ﬁ nancial need of the Employee only ifi. all plans maintained by the Employer provide that the Employee’s Elective Deferrals will be suspended for six months (12 months for hardship distributions before 2002) after the receipt of the hardship distribution; andii. for hardship distributions before 2002, all plans maintained by the Employer provide that the Employee may not make Elective Deferrals for the Employee’s taxable year immediately following the taxable year of the hardship distribution in excess of the applicable limit under Code section 402(g) for such taxable year less the amount of such Employee’s Elective Deferrals for the taxable year of the hardship distribution.3. Qualiﬁ ed Reservist Distributions—Participants may take penalty-free qualiﬁ ed reservist distributions from the Plan. A qualiﬁ ed reservist distribution means any distribution to a Participant where 1) such distribution is made from Elective Deferrals, 2) such Participant was ordered or called to active duty for a period in excess of 179 days or for an indeﬁ nite period, and 3) such distribution is made during the period beginning on the date of such order or call and ending at the close of the active duty period. The Participant must have been ordered or called to active duty after September 11, 2001.D. Miscellaneous Distribution Issues 1. Distribution of Rollover and Transfer Contributions—The following rules will apply with respect to entitlement to distribution of rollover and transfer contributions. a. Entitlement to Distribution—Rollover contributions (including rollovers of nondeductible employee contributions) and earnings thereon may be distributed at any time upon request. Transfer contributions may be distributed at any time upon request.  To the extent that any optional form of beneﬁ t under this Plan permits a distribution before the Employee’s retirement, death, Disability, attainment of Normal Retirement Age, or Termination of Employment, or before Plan termination, the optional form of ben-eﬁ t is not available with respect to beneﬁ ts attributable to assets (including the post-transfer earnings thereon) and liabilities that are transferred (within the meaning of Code section 414(l)) to this Plan from a money purchase pension plan or a target beneﬁ t pension plan qualiﬁ ed under Code section 401(a) (other than any portion of those assets and liabilities attributable to voluntary employee contributions). In addition, if such transfers consist of Elective Deferrals (including earnings thereon) from a 401(k) plan, the assets transferred will continue to be subject to the distribution restrictions under Code sections 401(k)(2) and 401(k)(10). b. Direct Rollovers of Eligible Rollover Distributions –A Recipient may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution that is equal to at least $500 (or such lesser amount if the Plan Administrator permits in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner) paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan speciﬁ ed by the Recipient in a Direct Rollover. 2. Commencement of Beneﬁ ts—Notwithstanding any other provision, unless the Participant elects otherwise, distribution of beneﬁ ts will begin no later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the Plan Year in whicha. the Participant attains age 65 (or Normal Retirement Age, if earlier),Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1218-19 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Notwithstanding the preceding, the failure of a Participant (and Spouse, if applicable) to consent to a distribution while a beneﬁ t is immediately distributable, within the meaning of Plan Section 5.01(B)(2), will be deemed to be an election to defer commencement of pay-ment of any beneﬁ t sufﬁ cient to satisfy this Plan Section 5.01(D)(2). 3. Federally Declared Disaster—If allowed by the Plan Sponsor, Participants may have previously requested or may in the future request a distribution of, or a loan from, the Vested portion of their Individual Account balance related to federally declared disaster area tax relief (e.g., Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005, Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008), as speciﬁ ed by the Plan Sponsor and as allowed under the Code and any additional rules, regulations, or other pronouncements promulgated by either the IRS or DOL.5.02 Form of Distribution to a Participant If the value of the Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $1,000 and the Participant has properly waived the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity (if applicable), as described in Plan Section 5.10, the Participant may request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) that the Individual Account be paid to them in one or more of the following forms of payment: 1) in a lump sum, 2) in a non-recurring partial payment, 3) in installment payments (a series of regularly scheduled recurring partial payments), or 4) applied to the purchase of an annuity contract. Notwithstanding the preceding, non-recurring partial payments may be made from the Plan either before Termination of Employment or to satisfy the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9).5.03 Distributions Upon the Death of a ParticipantA. Designation of Beneﬁ ciary—Spousal Consent—Each Participant may designate, in a form or manner approved by and delivered to the Plan Administrator, one or more primary and contingent Beneﬁ ciaries to receive all or a speciﬁ ed portion of the Participant’s Individual Account in the event of the Participant’s death. A Participant may change or revoke such Beneﬁ ciary designation by completing and delivering the proper form to the Plan Administrator. In the event that a Participant wishes to designate a Primary Beneﬁ ciary who is not their Spouse, their Spouse must consent (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to such designation, and the Spouse’s consent must acknowledge the effect of such designation and be witnessed by a notary public or plan representative. Notwithstanding this consent requirement, if the Participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Plan Administrator that such consent may not be obtained because there is no Spouse or the Spouse cannot be located, no consent will be required. In addition, if the Spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, the Spouse’s legal guardian, even if the guardian is the Participant, may give consent. If the Participant is legally separated or the Participant has been aban-doned (within the meaning of local law) and the Participant has a court order to such effect, spousal consent is not required unless a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order provides otherwise. Any change of Beneﬁ ciary will require a new spousal consent to the extent required by the Code or Treasury Regulations. B. Payment to Beneﬁ ciary—If a Participant dies before the Participant’s entire Individual Account has been paid to them, such deceased Participant’s Individual Account will be payable to any surviving Beneﬁ ciary designated by the Participant, or, if no Beneﬁ ciary survives the Participant, to the Participant’s Spouse, or, where no Spouse exists, to the Participant’s estate. If the Beneﬁ ciary is a minor, distribution will be deemed to have been made to such Beneﬁ ciary if the portion of the Participant’s Individual Account to which the Beneﬁ ciary is entitled is paid to their legal guardian or, if applicable, to their custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. If a Beneﬁ ciary is not a minor but is not legally competent to request or consent to a distribution, distributions will be deemed to have been made to such Beneﬁ ciary if the portion of the Participant’s Individual Account to which the Beneﬁ ciary is entitled is paid to the Participant’s court-appointed guardian, an attorney-in-fact acting under a valid power of attorney, or any other individual or entity authorized under state law to act on behalf of the Beneﬁ ciary. A Beneﬁ ciary may disclaim their portion of a Participant’s Individual Account by providing the Plan Administrator written notiﬁ cation pursuant to Code section 2518(b). C. Distribution Request—When Distributed—A Beneﬁ ciary of a deceased Participant entitled to a distribution who wishes to receive a distribution must submit a request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator. If required in writing, such request will be made on a form provided or approved by the Plan Administrator. Upon a valid request, the Plan Administrator shall direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to commence distribution as soon as administratively fea-sible after the request is received. 5.04 Form of Distribution to Beneﬁ ciariesA. Value of Individual Account Does Not Exceed $5,000—If the value of the a Participant’s Individual Account does not exceed $5,000, the value of a Participant’s Individual Account may be made to the Beneﬁ ciary in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribution under the Plan, as soon as administratively feasible.The value of the Participant’s Individual Account for purposes of this paragraph will be determined by including rollover contributions (and earnings allocable thereto) within the meaning of Code sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3)(A)(ii), and 457(e)(16).B. Value of Individual Account Exceeds $5,000—If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $5,000, the preretirement survivor annuity requirements of Plan Section 5.10 will apply unless waived in accordance with that Plan Section 5.10 or unless the Retirement Equity Act safe harbor rules of Plan Section 5.10(E) apply. However, a surviving Spouse Beneﬁ ciary may elect any form of payment allowable under the Plan in lieu of the preretirement survivor annuity. Any such payment to the surviving Spouse must meet the requirements of Plan Section 5.05.If the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $5,000 and either (1) the preretirement survivor annuity requirements of Plan Section 5.10 have been satisﬁ ed or waived in accordance or (2) the Retirement Equity Act safe harbor rules of Plan Section 5.10(E) apply, the value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account may be made to the Beneﬁ ciary in a single lump sum in lieu of all other forms of distribution under the Plan, as soon as administratively feasible.C. Other Forms of Distribution to Beneﬁ ciary—If the value of a Participant’s Individual Account exceeds $5,000 and the Participant has properly waived the preretirement survivor annuity, as described in Plan Section 5.10 (if applicable), or if the Beneﬁ ciary is the Participant’s sur-viving Spouse, the Beneﬁ ciary may, subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.05, request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) that the Participant’s Individual Account be paid in any form of distribution permitted to be taken by the Participant under this Plan other than applying the Individual Account toward the purchase of an annuity contract. Notwithstanding the preceding, installment payments to a Beneﬁ ciary cannot be made over a period exceeding the Life Expectancy of such Beneﬁ ciary.Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, a Beneﬁ ciary is permitted (subject to regulatory guidance) to directly roll over their portion of the Individual Account to an inherited individual retirement arrangement (under Code sections 408 or 408A). Such Direct Rollovers must other-wise qualify as Eligible Rollover Distributions. 5.05 Required Minimum Distribution Requirements A. General Rules1. Subject to Plan Section 5.10, the requirements of this Plan Section 5.05 will apply to any distribution of a Participant’s interest and will \\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1218-19 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Unless otherwise speciﬁ ed, the provisions of this Plan Section 5.05 apply to calendar years beginning after December 31, 2002.2. All distributions required under this Plan Section 5.05 will be deter-mined and made in accordance with Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9), including the minimum distribution incidental beneﬁ t requirement of Code section 401(a)(9)(G). 3. Limits on Distribution Periods—As of the ﬁ rst Distribution Calendar Year, distributions to a Participant, if not made in a single sum, may only be made over one of the following periods (or a combina-tion thereof): a. the life of the Participant,b. the joint lives of the Participant and a Designated Beneﬁ ciary,c. a period certain not extending beyond the Life Expectancy of the Participant, ord. a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and a Designated Beneﬁ ciary. B. Time and Manner of Distribution1. Required Beginning Date—The Participant’s entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant’s Required Beginning Date. For purposes of this Plan Section 5.05(B) and Plan Section 5.05(D), unless Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(iii) applies, distributions are consid-ered to begin on the Participant’s Required Beginning Date. If Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(iii) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(i). If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably com-mence to the Participant before the Participant’s Required Beginning Date (or to the Participant’s surviving Spouse before the date distri-butions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse in Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(i)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. Except as provided in a separate IRS model amendment, if appli-cable, Participants or Beneﬁ ciaries may elect on an individual basis whether the ﬁ ve-year rule or the life expectancy rule in Plan Section 5.05(D) applies to distributions after the death of a Participant who has a Designated Beneﬁ ciary. The election must be made no later than the earlier of September 30 of the calendar year in which distri-bution would be required to begin under this Plan Section 5.05(B), or by September 30 of the calendar year that contains the ﬁ fth anniver-sary of the Participant’s (or, if applicable, surviving Spouse’s) death. If neither the Participant nor the Beneﬁ ciary makes an election under this paragraph, distributions will be made in accordance with this Plan Section 5.05(B) and Plan Section 5.05(D) and, if applicable, the election in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable).2. Forms of Distribution—Unless the Participant’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the ﬁ rst Distribution Calendar Year distributions will be made in accor-dance with Plan Section 5.05(C) and Plan Section 5.05(D). If the Participant’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity pur-chased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding Treasury Regulations.C. Required Minimum Distributions During Participant’s Lifetime1. Amount of Required Minimum Distribution for Each Distribution Calendar Year—During the Participant’s lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year is the lesser of:a. the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s Beneﬁ t by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-9, Q&A 2, using the Participant’s age as of the Participant’s birthday in the Distribution Calendar Year; orb. if the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary for the Distribution Calendar Year is the Participant’s Spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s Beneﬁ t by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-9, Q&A 3, using the Participant’s and Spouse’s attained ages as of the Participant’s and Spouse’s birthdays in the Distribution Calendar Year. 2. Lifetime Required Minimum Distributions Continue Through Year of Participant’s Death—Required minimum distributions will be deter-mined under this Plan Section 5.05(C) beginning with the ﬁ rst Distribution Calendar Year and up to and including the Distribution Calendar Year that includes the Participant’s date of death.D. Required Minimum Distributions After Participant’s Death1. Death On or After Date Distributions Begina. Participant Survived by Designated Beneﬁ ciary—If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneﬁ ciary, the minimum amount that will be distrib-uted for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s beneﬁ t by the longer of the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant or the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant’s Designated Beneﬁ ciary, determined as follows:i. The Participant’s remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.ii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving Spouse is calculated for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death using the surviving Spouse’s age as of the Spouse’s birthday in that year. For Distribution Calendar Years after the year of the surviving Spouse’s death, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving Spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving Spouse as of the Spouse’s birthday in the calendar year of the Spouse’s death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year.iii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is not the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary, the Designated Beneﬁ ciary’s remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Designated Beneﬁ ciary in the year following the year of the Participant’s death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.b. No Designated Beneﬁ ciary—If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneﬁ ciary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant’s death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s beneﬁ t by the Participant’s remaining Life Expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.2. Death Before Date Distributions Begina. Participant Survived by Designated Beneﬁ ciary—Except as provided in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable, or as elected by a Designated Beneﬁ ciary pursuant to Plan Section 5.05(B)(1), if the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneﬁ ciary, the minimum amount that will be distrib-uted for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant’s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant’s beneﬁ t by the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant’s Designated Beneﬁ ciary, determined as provided in Plan Section 5.05(D)(1).Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1220-21 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary, then, (except as provided in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable), distributions to the surviv-ing Spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70½, if later.ii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is not the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary, then, (except as provided in a separate IRS model amendment, if applicable), distributions to the Designated Beneﬁ ciary will begin by December 31 of the calen-dar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died. iii. If the Participant’s surviving Spouse is the Participant’s sole Designated Beneﬁ ciary and the surviving Spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving Spouse are required to begin, this Plan Section 5.05(D)(2), other than Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a), will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant.b. No Designated Beneﬁ ciary—If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneﬁ ciary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant’s death, distribution of the Participant’s entire interest will be com-pleted by December 31 of the calendar year containing the ﬁ fth anniversary of the Participant’s death.3. Election to Allow Designated Beneﬁ ciary Receiving Distributions Under Five-Year Rule to Elect Life Expectancy Distributions—Unless speciﬁ ed otherwise in a separate IRS model amendment, a Designated Beneﬁ ciary who is receiving payments under the ﬁ ve-year rule may have made a new election to receive payments under the life expectancy rule until December 31, 2003, provided that all amounts that would have been required to be distributed under the life expectancy rule for all distribution calendar years before 2004 are distributed by the earlier of December 31, 2003 or the end of the ﬁ ve-year period.E. TEFRA Section 242(b) Elections1. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Plan Section 5.05 and subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10, Joint and Survivor Annuity Requirements, distribution on behalf of any Employee (or former Employee), including a ﬁ ve-percent owner, who has made a designation under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 Section 242(b)(2) (a “Section 242(b)(2) Election”) may be made in accordance with all of the following requirements (regardless of when such distribution commences).a. The distribution by the Fund is one which would not have qualiﬁ ed such Fund under Code section 401(a)(9) as in effect before amend-ment by the Deﬁ cit Reduction Act of 1984.b. The distribution is in accordance with a method of distribution designated by the Employee whose interest in the Fund is being distributed or, if the Employee is deceased, by a Beneﬁ ciary of such Employee.c. Such designation was in writing, was signed by the Employee or the Beneﬁ ciary, and was made before January 1, 1984.d. The Employee had accrued a beneﬁ t under the Plan as of December 31, 1983.e. The method of distribution designated by the Employee or the Beneﬁ ciary speciﬁ es the time at which distribution will commence, the period over which distributions will be made, and in the case of any distribution upon the Employee’s death, the Beneﬁ ciaries of the Employee listed in order of priority.2. A distribution upon death will not be covered by this transitional rule unless the information in the designation contains the required information described above with respect to the distributions to be made upon the death of the Employee.3. If a designation is revoked, any subsequent distribution must satisfy the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding regulations. If a designation is revoked subsequent to the date distributions are required to begin, the Plan must distribute, by the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the revocation occurs, the total amount not yet distributed which would have been required to have been distributed to satisfy Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding regulations, but for an election made under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Section 242(b)(2). For calendar years beginning after December 31, 1988, such distributions must meet the minimum distribution inci-dental beneﬁ t requirements. Any changes in the designation will be considered to be a revocation of the designation. However, the mere substitution or addition of another Beneﬁ ciary (one not named in the designation) under the designation will not be considered to be a revocation of the designation, provided such substitution or addition does not alter the period over which distributions are to be made under the designation, directly or indirectly (for example, by altering the relevant measuring life). 4. In the case in which an amount is transferred or rolled over from one plan to another plan, the rules in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(9)-8, Q&A 14 and Q&A 15, will apply.F. Transition Rules—For plans in existence before 2003, required minimum distributions before 2003 were made pursuant to Plan Section 5.05(E), if applicable, and Plan Sections 5.05(F)(1) through 5.05(F)(3) below.1. 2000 and Before—Required minimum distributions for calendar years after 1984 and before 2001 were made in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding Proposed Treasury Regulations published in the Federal Register on July 27, 1987 (the “1987 Proposed Regulations”).2. 2001—Required minimum distributions for calendar year 2001 were made in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the Proposed Treasury Regulations in Section 401(a)(9) as published in the Federal Register on January 17, 2001 (the “2001 Proposed Regulations”) unless a prior IRS model amendment provision was adopted that stated that the required minimum distributions for 2001 were made pursuant to the 1987 Proposed Regulations. If distributions were made in 2001 under the 1987 Proposed Regulations before the date in 2001 that the Plan began operating under the 2001 Proposed Regulations, the special transition rule in Announcement 2001-82, 2001-2 C.B. 123, applied.3. 2002—Required minimum distributions for calendar year 2002 were made in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the 2001 Proposed Regulations unless the prior IRS model amendment, if applicable, provided that either a. or b. below applies.a. Required minimum distributions for 2002 were made pursuant to the 1987 Proposed Regulations.b. Required minimum distributions for 2002 were made pursuant to the Final and Temporary Treasury Regulations under Code section 401(a)(9) published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2002 (the “2002 Final and Temporary Regulations”), which are described in Plan Sections 5.05(B) through 5.05(E). If distributions were made in 2002 under either the 1987 Proposed Regulations or the 2001 Proposed Regulations before the date in 2002 on which the Plan began operating under the 2002 Final and Temporary Regulations, the special transition rule in Section 1.2 of the model amendment in Revenue Procedure 2002-29, 2002-1 C.B. 1176, applied.G. Temporary Waiver of Required Minimum Distribution Requirements—Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or the deﬁ nition of Distribution Calendar Year to the contrary, Participants and Beneﬁ ciaries who would have been required to receive a 2009 RMD or Extended 2009 RMD but for the enactment of Code section 401(a)(9)(H) were given the choice to receive such distributions for 2009. If a Participant or Beneﬁ ciary described above was allowed to remove their 2009 RMD or Extended 2009 RMD but did not elect to receive such amount, the 2009 RMD or Extended 2009 RMD was retained in the Plan. \\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1220-21 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The terms of any annuity contract purchased and distributed by the Plan to a Participant or Spouse will comply with the requirements of the Plan.5.07 Distributions In-KindThe Plan Administrator may, but need not, cause any distribution under this Plan to be made either in a form actually held in the Fund, or in cash by converting assets other than cash into cash, or in any combina-tion of the two preceding methods. Assets other than cash, or other assets with a readily ascertainable market value, must be subject to a third-party appraisal before they may be distributed from the Plan.5.08 Procedure for Missing Participants or Beneﬁ ciariesThe Plan Administrator must use all reasonable measures to locate Participants or Beneﬁ ciaries who are entitled to distributions from the Plan. Such measures may include using certiﬁ ed mail, checking records of other plans maintained by the Employer, contacting the Participant’s Beneﬁ ciaries, using a governmental letter-forwarding service, or using internet search tools, commercial locator services, and credit reporting agencies. The Plan Administrator should consider the cost of the mea-sures relative to the Individual Account balance when determining which measures are used.In the event that the Plan Administrator cannot locate a Participant or Beneﬁ ciary who is entitled to a distribution from the Plan after using all reasonable measures, the Plan Administrator may, consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and other pronouncements under the Code and ERISA, use any reasonable procedure to dispose of distributable Plan assets, including any of the following: 1) establish an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), under Code section 408, that complies with the automatic rollover safe harbor regulations, without regard to the amount in the Individual Account, 2) establish a federally insured bank account for and in the name of the Participant or Beneﬁ ciary and transfer the assets to such bank account, 3) purchase an annuity con-tract with the assets in the name of the Participant or Beneﬁ ciary (unless an annuity form of distribution is prohibited under the Plan), or 4) transfer the assets to the unclaimed property fund of the state in which the Participant or Beneﬁ ciary was last known to reside. In the event the Plan is terminated, payments must be made in a man-ner that protects the beneﬁ t rights of a Participant or Beneﬁ ciary. Beneﬁ t rights will be deemed to be protected if the amount in a Participant’s or Beneﬁ ciary’s Individual Account is placed into an IRA, used to purchase an annuity contract, or transferred to another quali-ﬁ ed retirement plan. Beneﬁ t rights need not, however, be protected if an Individual Account becomes subject to state escheat laws, or if a pay-ment is made to satisfy Code section 401(a)(9), or if such other pro-cess is followed that is consistent with applicable statutory or regulatory guidance.5.09 Claims ProceduresA. Filing a Claim for Plan Distributions—A Participant or Beneﬁ ciary who has been denied a request for a distribution or loan and desires to make a claim for the Participant’s Individual Account will ﬁ le a request (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL and acceptable to the Plan Administrator) with the Plan Administrator. If such request is required in writing, such request must be made on a form furnished to them by the Plan Administrator for such purpose. The request will set forth the basis of the claim. The Plan Administrator is authorized to conduct such examinations as may be necessary to facilitate the payment of any beneﬁ ts to which the Participant or Beneﬁ ciary may be entitled under the terms of the Plan. B. Denial of a Claim—Whenever a claim for a Plan distribution or loan submitted in accordance with this Plan Section 5.09 by any Participant or Beneﬁ ciary has been wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator must furnish such Participant or Beneﬁ ciary notice (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) of the denial within 90 days (45 days for claims involving disability beneﬁ ts) of the date the original claim was ﬁ led. This notice will set forth the speciﬁ c reasons for the denial, speciﬁ c reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based, a description of any addi-tional information or material needed to perfect the claim, an explana-tion of why such additional information or material is necessary, and an explanation of the procedures for appeal. C. Remedies Available—The Participant or Beneﬁ ciary will have 60 days from receipt of the denial notice in which to make written application for review by the Plan Administrator. The Participant or Beneﬁ ciary may request that the review be in the nature of a hearing. The Participant or Beneﬁ ciary will have the right to representation, to review pertinent documents, and to submit comments in writing (or in any other form permitted by the IRS or DOL). The Plan Administrator shall issue a decision on such review within 60 days (45 days for claims involving disability beneﬁ ts) after receipt of an application for review as provided for in this Plan Section 5.09. Upon a decision unfavorable to the Participant or Beneﬁ ciary, such Participant or Beneﬁ ciary will be entitled to bring such actions in law or equity as may be necessary or appropri-ate to protect or clarify their right to beneﬁ ts under this Plan.5.10 Joint and Survivor Annuity RequirementsA. Application—The provisions of this Plan Section 5.10 will apply to any Participant who is credited with at least one Hour of Service with the Employer on or after August 23, 1984, and such other Participants as provided in Treasury Regulations.B. Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity—Unless an optional form of beneﬁ t is selected pursuant to a Qualiﬁ ed Election within the 180-day period ending on the Annuity Starting Date, a married Participant’s Individual Account Balance will be paid in the form of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity and an unmarried Participant’s account balance will be paid in the form of a life annuity. The Participant may elect to have such annuity distributed upon attainment of the Earliest Retirement Age under the Plan. In the case of a married Participant, the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity must be at least as valuable as any other optional form of beneﬁ t payable under the Plan at the same time.A Plan that is subject to the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity require-ments must offer an additional survivor annuity option in the form of a Qualiﬁ ed Optional Survivor Annuity. C. Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity—Unless an optional form of beneﬁ t has been selected within the Election Period pursuant to a Qualiﬁ ed Election, if a Participant dies before the Annuity Starting Date then the Participant’s Individual Account shall be applied toward the purchase of an annuity for the life of the surviving Spouse. The surviv-ing Spouse may elect to have such annuity distributed within a reason-able period after the Participant’s death.D. Notice Requirements1. In the case of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity, the Plan Administrator shall no less than 30 days and not more than 180 days before the Annuity Starting Date provide each Participant an explanation (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) of 1) the terms and condi-tions of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity, 2) the Participant’s right to make and the effect of an election to waive the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity form of beneﬁ t, 3) the rights of a Participant’s Spouse, and 4) the right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of a previous election to waive the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity. The written explanation shall comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.417(a)(3)-1. The Annuity Starting Date for a distribution in a form other than a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity may be less than 30 days after receipt of the explanation described in the preceding paragraph Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1222-23 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

In the case of a Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity as described in Plan Section 5.10(C), the Plan Administrator shall provide each Participant within the applicable period for such Participant an expla-nation (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) of the Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity in such terms and in such manner as would be comparable to the explanation provided for meeting the requirements of Plan Section 5.10(D)(1) applicable to a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity. The written explanation shall comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.417(a)(3)-1. The applicable period for a Participant is whichever of the following periods ends last: 1) the period beginning with the ﬁ rst day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 32 and ending with the close of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 35, 2) a reasonable period ending after the individual becomes a Participant, 3) a reasonable period ending after Plan Section 5.10(D)(3) ceases to apply to the Participant, and 4) a reasonable period ending after this Plan Section 5.10 ﬁ rst applies to the Participant. Notwithstanding the preceding, notice must be provided within a reasonable period ending after separation from service in the case of a Participant who separates from service before attaining age 35. For purposes of applying the preceding paragraph, a reasonable period ending after the enumerated events described in 2), 3) and 4) is the end of the two-year period beginning one year before the date the applicable event occurs, and ending one year after that date. In the case of a Participant who separates from service before the Plan Year in which age 35 is attained, notice will be provided within the two-year period beginning one year before separation and ending one year after separation. If such a Participant thereafter returns to employment with the Employer, the applicable period for such Participant will be redetermined.3. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Plan Section 5.10(D), the respective notices prescribed by this Plan Section 5.10(D) need not be given to a Participant if 1) the Plan “fully subsidizes” the costs of a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity, and 2) the Plan does not allow the Participant to waive the Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity and does not allow a married Participant to designate a non-Spouse Beneﬁ ciary. For purposes of this Plan Section 5.10(D)(3), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a beneﬁ t if no increase in cost or decrease in beneﬁ ts to the Participant may result from the Participant’s failure to elect another beneﬁ t.E. Retirement Equity Act Safe Harbor Rules1. The safe harbor provisions of this Plan Section 5.10(E) shall always apply to any distribution made on or after the ﬁ rst day of the ﬁ rst Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1988, from or under a separate account attributable solely to accumulated deductible employee contributions, as deﬁ ned in Code section 72(o)(5)(B), and maintained on behalf of a Participant in a money purchase pension plan, if the following conditions are satisﬁ ed:a. the Participant does not or cannot elect payments in the form of a life annuity; andb. on the death of a Participant, the Participant’s account balance will be paid to the Participant’s surviving Spouse, but if there is no surviving Spouse, or if the surviving Spouse has consented in a manner conforming to a Qualiﬁ ed Election, then to the Participant’s Designated Beneﬁ ciary. The surviving Spouse may elect to have distribution of the account balance commence within the 180-day period following the date of the Participant’s death. The account balance shall be adjusted for gains or losses occurring after the Participant’s death in accordance with the provisions of the Plan governing the adjustment of account balances for other types of distributions. This Plan Section 5.10(E) will not apply to a Participant in a proﬁ t sharing plan if the plan is a direct or indirect transferee of a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan, money purchase pension plan, a target beneﬁ t pension plan, stock bonus, or proﬁ t sharing plan that is subject to the survivor annuity requirements of Code sec-tions 401(a)(11) and 417. If this Plan Section 5.10(E) applies, then no other provisions of this Plan Section 5.10 will apply except as provided in Treasury Regulations.2. The Participant may waive the spousal death beneﬁ t described in this Plan Section 5.10(E) at any time provided that no such waiver will be effective unless it is a Qualiﬁ ed Election (other than the notiﬁ cation requirement referred to therein) that would apply to the Participant’s waiver of the Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity.3. In the event this Plan is a direct or indirect transferee of or a restatement of a plan previously subject to the survivor annuity requirements of Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417 and the Employer has selected to have this Plan Section 5.10(E) apply, the provisions of this Plan Section 5.10(E) will not apply to any beneﬁ ts accrued (including subsequent adjustments for earnings and losses) before the adoption of these provisions. Such amounts will be separately accounted for in a manner consistent with Plan Section 7.02 and administered in accordance with the general survivor annuity require-ments of Plan Section 5.10. 5.11 Liability for Withholding on DistributionsThe Plan Administrator shall be responsible for withholding federal income taxes from distributions from the Plan, unless the Participant (or Beneﬁ ciary, where applicable) elects not to have such taxes withheld. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or other payor may act as agent for the Plan Administrator to withhold such taxes and to make the appropri-ate distribution reports, provided the Plan Administrator furnishes all the information to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or other payor which such payor may need to properly perform withholding and reporting. 5.12 Distribution of Excess Elective DeferralsA. General Rule—A Participant may assign to this Plan any Excess Elective Deferrals made during a taxable year of the Participant by notifying the Plan Administrator of the amount of the Excess Elective Deferrals to be assigned to the Plan. Participants who claim Excess Elective Deferrals for the preceding calendar year must submit their claims (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator by March 1. A Participant is deemed to notify the Plan Administrator of any Excess Elective Deferrals that arise by taking into account only those Elective Deferrals made to this Plan and any other plan, contract, or arrange-ment of the Employer.Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, Excess Elective Deferrals, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto, will be distributed no later than April 15th to any Participant to whose Individual Account Excess Elective Deferrals were assigned for the preceding year and who claims Excess Elective Deferrals for such tax-able year, except to the extent such Excess Elective Deferrals were classiﬁ ed as Catch-up Contributions. For years beginning after 2005, the Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, will determine whether the distribution of Excess Elective Deferrals for a year will be made ﬁ rst from the Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferral account or the Roth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, to the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify otherwise.B. Determination of Income or Loss—For taxable years beginning after 2007, Excess Elective Deferrals will be adjusted for any income or loss \\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1222-23 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals is the income or loss allocable to the Participant’s Elective Deferral account for the taxable year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is such Participant’s Excess Elective Deferrals for the year and the denom-inator of which is the Participant’s Individual Account balance attribut-able to Elective Deferrals without regard to any income or loss occurring during such taxable year. For taxable years beginning before 2008, income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals also included ten percent of the amount determined under the preceding sentence multi-plied by the number of whole calendar months between the end of the Participant’s taxable year and the date of distribution, counting the month of distribution if distribution occurs after the 15th of such month. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Plan Administrator may compute the income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B) (i.e., the usual manner used by the Plan for allocating income or loss to Participants’ Individual Accounts or any reasonable method), provided such method is used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year. The Plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the income or loss on Excess Elective Deferrals merely because the income allocable is based on a date that is no more than seven days before the distribution.5.13 Distribution of Excess ContributionsA. General Rule—Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, Excess Contributions, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto, will be distributed no later than 12 months after a Plan Year to Participants to whose Individual Accounts such Excess Contributions were allocated for such Plan Year, except to the extent such Excess Contributions were classiﬁ ed as Catch-up Contributions. Excess Contributions are allocated to the Highly Compensated Employees with the largest amounts of Employer Contributions taken into account in calculating the ADP test for the year in which the excess arose, begin-ning with the Highly Compensated Employee with the largest amount of such Employer Contributions and continuing in descending order until all the Excess Contributions have been allocated. Both the total amount of the Excess Contribution and, for purposes of the preceding sentence, the “largest amount” are determined after distribution of any Excess Deferrals. To the extent a Highly Compensated Employee has not reached their Catch-up Contribution limit under the Plan, Excess Contributions allocated to such Highly Compensated Employees as Catch-up Contributions will not be treated as Excess Contributions. If such Excess Contributions are distributed more than 2½ months after the last day of the Plan Year in which such Contributions were made, a ten-percent excise tax will be imposed on the Employer maintaining the Plan with respect to such amounts. Excess Contributions will be treated as annual additions under the Plan even if distributed.B. Determination of Income or Loss—For taxable years beginning after 2007, Excess Contributions will be adjusted for any income or loss up to the end of the Plan Year to which such contributions were allocated. The income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions allocated to each Participant is the income or loss allocable to the Participant’s Elective Deferral account(s) for the Plan Year multiplied by a fraction, the numer-ator of which is such Participant’s Excess Contributions for the year and the denominator of which is the Participant’s Individual Account balance attributable to Elective Deferrals without regard to any income or loss occurring during such Plan Year. For taxable years beginning before 2008, income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions also included ten percent of the amount determined under the preceding sentence multiplied by the number of whole calendar months between the end of the Participant’s taxable year and the date of distribution, counting the month of distribution if distribution occurs after the 15th of such month. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Plan Administrator may compute the income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B) (i.e., the usual manner used by the Plan for allocating income or loss to Participants’ Individual Accounts or any reasonable method), provided such method is used consistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year. The Plan will not fail to use a reasonable method for computing the income or loss on Excess Contributions merely because the income allocable is based on a date that is no more than seven days before the distribution.C. Accounting for Excess Contributions—Excess Contributions allocated to a Participant will be distributed from the Participant’s Elective Deferral account(s) in proportion to the Participant’s Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year. For years beginning after 2005, the Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, will either determine whether the distribution of Excess Contributions for a year will be made ﬁ rst from the Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferral account or the Roth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, to the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals were made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify otherwise. 5.14 Loans to ParticipantsIf the Adoption Agreement so indicates, a Participant may receive a loan from the Fund, subject to the following rules and the Plan’s loan policy.A. Loans will be made available to all Participants on a reasonably equivalent basis. Notwithstanding the preceding, new loans will not be available to Participants who cease to be employed by the Employer, unless such Participants are parties-in-interest as deﬁ ned in ERISA section 3(14). In addition, existing loans will be considered due and payable at such time as a Participant ceases to be an Employee, and the loan will be considered in default and the Participant’s Individual Account will be reduced by the outstanding amount of the loan unless otherwise speciﬁ ed in the loan policy statement or other loan documen-tation.B. Loans will not be made available to Highly Compensated Employees in an amount greater than the amount made available to other Employees.C. Loans must be adequately secured and bear a reasonable interest rate.D. No Participant loan will exceed the Present Value of the Vested portion of a Participant’s Individual Account. E. A Participant must obtain the consent of their Spouse, if any, to the use of the Individual Account as security for the loan. Spousal consent will be obtained no earlier than the beginning of the 90-day period that ends on the date on which the loan is to be so secured. The consent must be in writing (or any other form permitted by the IRS and DOL), must acknowledge the effect of the loan, and must be witnessed by a notary public or plan representative. Such consent will thereafter be binding with respect to the consenting Spouse or any subsequent Spouse with respect to that loan. A new consent will be required if the Individual Account is used for renegotiation, extension, renewal, or other revision of the loan. Notwithstanding the preceding, no spousal consent is necessary if, at the time the loan is secured, no consent would be required for a distribution under Code section 417(a)(2)(B). In addition, spousal consent is not required if the Plan or the Participant is not subject to Code section 401(a)(11) at the time the Individual Account is used as security, or if the total Individual Account subject to the secu-rity is less than or equal to $5,000.F. In the event of default, foreclosure on the note and attachment of security will not occur until a distribution eligibility requirement is met under the Plan.G. For plan loans made before January 1, 2002, no loans will be made to any shareholder-employee or Owner-Employee. For purposes of this requirement, a shareholder-employee means an employee or ofﬁ cer of an electing small business (Subchapter S) corporation who owns (or is considered as owning within the meaning of Code section 318(a)(1)), on any day during the taxable year of such corporation, more than ﬁ ve-percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation.H. Loan repayments will be suspended under the Plan as permitted under Code section 414(u)(4) (USERRA).I. For years beginning after 2005, if the Participant’s Individual Account contains any combination of Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals, the speciﬁ c rules governing the loan program may Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1224-25 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

To the extent permitted by law and related regula-tions, the rules established by the Plan Sponsor may specify the order-ing rules to be applied in the event of a defaulted loan.If a valid spousal consent has been obtained in accordance with Plan Section 5.14(E), then, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, the portion of the Participant’s Individual Account used as a security interest held by the Plan by reason of a loan outstanding to the Participant will be taken into account for purposes of determining the amount of the Individual Account payable at the time of death or distri-bution, but only if the reduction is used as repayment of the loan. If less than 100 percent of the Participant’s Individual Account (deter-mined without regard to the preceding sentence) is payable to the surviving Spouse, then the Individual Account will be adjusted by ﬁ rst reducing the Individual Account by the amount of the security used as repayment of the loan, and then determining the beneﬁ t payable to the surviving Spouse.To avoid taxation to the Participant, unless otherwise permitted by law or regulatory guidance, no loan to any Participant or Beneﬁ ciary can be made to the extent that such loan, when added to the outstanding balance of all other loans to the Participant, would exceed the lesser of 1) $50,000 reduced by the excess (if any) of the highest outstanding balance of loans during the one year period ending on the day before the loan is made, over the outstanding balance of loans from the Plan on the date the loan is made, or 2) 50 percent of the Present Value of the nonforfeitable Individual Account of the Participant. For the purpose of the above limitation, all loans from all plans of the Employer and other members of a group of employers described in Code sections 414(b), 414(c), and 414(m) are aggregated. Furthermore, any loan will by its terms require that repayment (principal and interest) be amortized in level payments, not less frequently than quarterly, over a period not extending beyond ﬁ ve years from the date of the loan, unless such loan is used to acquire a dwelling unit which, within a reasonable time (deter-mined at the time the loan is made), will be used as the principal resi-dence of the Participant. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Participant will suspend their loan repayments under this Plan as permitted under Code section 414(u)(4). An assignment or pledge of any portion of the Participant’s interest in the Plan and a loan, pledge, or assignment with respect to any insurance contract purchased under the Plan, will be treated as a loan under this paragraph.The Plan Administrator shall administer the loan program in accordance with speciﬁ c rules that are documented either in writing or in such other format as permitted by the IRS and the DOL. Such rules will include, at a minimum, the following: 1) the identity of the person or positions authorized to administer the Participant loan program, 2) the procedure for applying for loans, 3) the basis on which loans will be approved or denied, 4) limitations (if any) on the types and amounts of loans offered, 5) the procedure under the program for determining a reason-able rate of interest, 6) the types of collateral that may secure a Participant loan, and 7) the events constituting default and the steps that will be taken to preserve Plan assets in the event of such default.Section Six: Deﬁ nitionsWords and phrases used in the Plan with initial capital letters will, for the purpose of this Plan, have the meanings set forth in the portion of the Plan entitled “Deﬁ nitions” unless the context indicates that other meanings are intended. Section Seven: Miscellaneous7.01 The FundA. Establishment and Maintenance—By adopting this Plan, the Employer establishes the Fund, which will consist of the assets of the Plan held by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) pursuant to Section Eight. Assets within the Fund may be pooled on behalf of all Participants, earmarked on behalf of each Participant, or be a combina-tion of pooled and earmarked assets. To the extent that assets are earmarked for a particular Participant, they will be held in a Separate Fund for that Participant. No part of the corpus or income of the Fund may be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive beneﬁ t of Participants or their Beneﬁ ciaries. The Fund will be valued each Valuation Date at fair market value. B. Division of Fund Into Investment Funds—The Employer may direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to divide and redivide the Fund into one or more Investment Funds. Such Investment Funds may include, but are not limited to, Investment Funds representing the assets under the control of an investment manager pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(C) and Investment Funds representing investment options available for individual direction by Participants pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(B). Upon each division or redivision, the Employer may specify the part of the Fund to be allocated to each such Investment Fund and the terms and conditions, if any, under which the assets in such Investment Fund will be invested.7.02 Individual AccountsA. Establishment and Maintenance—The Plan Administrator shall estab-lish and maintain an Individual Account in the name of each Participant to reﬂ ect the total value of their interest in the Fund (including but not limited to Employer Contributions and earnings thereon). Each Individual Account established hereunder will consist of such subaccounts as may be needed for each Participant, including: 1. a subaccount to reﬂ ect Employer Contributions allocated on behalf of a Participant; 2. a subaccount to reﬂ ect a Participant’s rollover contributions; 3. a subaccount to reﬂ ect a Participant’s transfer contributions; 4. a subaccount to reﬂ ect a Participant’s Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals; and5. a subaccount to reﬂ ect a Participant’s Roth Elective Deferrals.The Plan Administrator may establish additional accounts as it may deem necessary for the proper administration of the Plan. If this Plan is funded by individual contracts that provide a Participant’s Beneﬁ t under the Plan, such individual contracts will constitute the Participant’s Individual Account. If this Plan is funded by group contracts under the group annuity or group insurance contract, premiums or other consideration received by the insurance company must be allocated to Participants’ Individual Accounts under the Plan.B. Valuation of Individual Accounts1. Where all or a portion of the assets of a Participant’s Individual Account are invested in a Separate Fund for the Participant, then the value of that portion of such Participant’s Individual Account at any relevant time equals the sum of the fair market values of the assets in such Separate Fund, less any applicable charges or penalties.2. The fair market value of the remainder of each Individual Account is determined in the following manner:a. Separate Fund—First, the portion of the Individual Account invested in each Investment Fund as of the previous Valuation Date is determined. Each such portion is reduced by any withdrawal made from the applicable Investment Fund to or for the beneﬁ t of a Participant or the Participant’s Beneﬁ ciary, further reduced by any transfer to another Investment Fund since the previous Valuation Date, and is increased by any amount transferred from another Investment Fund since the previous Valuation Date. The resulting amounts are the net Individual Account portions invested in the Investment Funds.b. No Separate Fund—Second, the net Individual Account portions invested in each Investment Fund are adjusted upwards or down-wards, pro rata (i.e., using the ratio of each net Individual Account portion to the sum of all net Individual Account portions) so that the sum of all the net Individual Account portions invested in an \\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1224-25 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, for the ﬁ rst Plan Year only, the net Individual Account portions will be the sum of all contributions made to each Participant’s Individual Account during the ﬁ rst Plan Year.c. Allocations—Third, any contributions to the Plan are allocated in accordance with the appropriate allocation provisions of Plan Section Three. For purposes of this Plan Section Seven, contributions made by the Employer for any Plan Year but after that Plan Year will be considered to have been made on the last day of that Plan Year regardless of when paid to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). Amounts contributed between Valuation Dates will not be credited with investment gains or losses until the next following Valuation Date.d. Aggregation of Portions—Finally, the portions of the Individual Account invested in each Investment Fund (determined in accor-dance with (a), (b), and (c) above) are added together.C. Modiﬁ cation of Method for Valuing Individual Accounts—If neces-sary or appropriate, the Plan Administrator may establish different or additional procedures (which will be uniform and nondiscrimina-tory) for determining the fair market value of the Individual Accounts including, but not limited to, valuation on a daily basis pursuant to the number of shares of each permissible investment held on behalf of a Participant. 7.03 Powers and Duties of the Plan AdministratorA. The Plan Administrator will have the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall administer the Plan for the exclusive beneﬁ t of the Participants and their Beneﬁ ciaries in accordance with the speciﬁ c terms of the Plan.B. The Plan Administrator may, by appointment, allocate the duties of the Plan Administrator among several individuals or entities. Such appointments will not be effective until the party designated accepts such appointment in writing.C. The Plan Administrator shall be charged with the duties of the general administration of the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following:1. to determine all questions of interpretation or policy in a manner consistent with the Plan’s documents. The Plan Administrator’s construction or determination in good faith will be conclusive and binding on all persons except as otherwise provided herein or by law. Any interpretation or construction will be done in a nondiscriminatory manner and will be consistent with the intent that the Plan will con-tinue to be deemed a qualiﬁ ed plan under the terms of Code section 401(a), as amended from time to time, and will comply with the terms of ERISA, as amended from time to time;2. to determine all questions relating to the eligibility of Employees to become or remain Participants hereunder;3. to compute the amounts necessary or desirable to be contributed to the Plan;4. to compute the amount and kind of beneﬁ ts to which a Participant or Beneﬁ ciary will be entitled under the Plan and to direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) with respect to all disbursements under the Plan, and, when requested by the Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-cable), to furnish the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) with instructions, in writing, on matters pertaining to the Plan on which the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) may rely and act;5. to maintain all records necessary for the administration of the Plan;6. to prepare and ﬁ le such disclosures and tax forms as may be required from time to time by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of the Treasury; 7. to furnish each Employee, Participant, or Beneﬁ ciary such notices, information, and reports under such circumstances as may be required by law;8. to periodically review the performance of each Fiduciary and all other relevant parties to ensure such individuals’ obligations under the Plan are performed in a manner that is acceptable under the Plan and applicable law; and 9. to furnish a statement to each Participant or Beneﬁ ciary no later than 270 days after the close of each Plan Year, indicating the Individual Account balances of such Participant as of the last Valuation Date in such Plan Year.D. The Plan Administrator will have all of the powers necessary or appropriate to accomplish their duties under the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following:1. to appoint and retain such persons as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Plan Administrator;2. to appoint and retain counsel, specialists, or other persons as the Plan Administrator deems necessary or advisable in the administra-tion of the Plan;3. to resolve all questions of administration of the Plan;4. to establish such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules that it deems necessary to carry out the terms of the Plan;5. to make any adjustments in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner that it deems necessary to correct any arithmetical or accounting errors that may have been made for any Plan Year;6. to correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsis-tency in such manner and to such extent as will be deemed neces-sary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the Plan; and7. if the Plan permits a form of distribution other than a lump sum, and a Participant elects such form of distribution, the Plan Administrator may place that Participant’s Individual Account into a segregated Investment Fund for the purpose of maintaining the necessary liquid-ity to provide beneﬁ t installments on a periodic basis. 7.04 Expenses and CompensationAll reasonable expenses of administration, including, but not limited to, those involved in retaining necessary professional assistance, may be paid from the assets of the Fund. Alternatively, the Employer may, in its discretion, pay any or all such expenses. Pursuant to uniform and non-discriminatory rules that the Plan Administrator may establish from time to time, administrative expenses and expenses unique to a particular Participant or group of Participants may be charged to the Individual Account of such Participant or may be assessed against terminated Participants even if not assessed against active Participants (subject to rules promulgated by the IRS and the DOL), or the Plan Administrator may allow Participants to pay such fees outside of the Plan. The Employer shall furnish the Plan Administrator with such clerical and other assistance as the Plan Administrator may need in the perfor-mance of their duties.7.05 Information from EmployerTo enable the Plan Administrator to perform their duties, the Employer shall supply complete, accurate, and timely information to the Plan Administrator (or their designated agents) on all matters relating to the Compensation of all Participants; their regular employment; retirement, death, Disability, Severance from Employment, or Termination of Employment; and such other pertinent facts as the Plan Administrator (or their agents) may require. The Plan Administrator shall advise the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) of such of the preceding facts as may be pertinent to the Trustee’s (or Custodian’s) duties under the Plan. The Plan Administrator (or their agents) is entitled to rely on such infor-mation as is supplied by the Employer and will have no duty or responsi-bility to verify such information. Such information, including authorizations and directions, may be exchanged among the Employer, the Plan Administrator, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), or their agents through electronic, telephonic, or other means (including, for example, through the internet) pursuant to applicable servicing arrange-ments in effect for the Plan.Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1226-27 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Right of Prototype Document Sponsor to Amend the Plan or Terminate Sponsorship1. The Employer, by adopting the Plan, expressly delegates to the Prototype Document Sponsor the power, but not the duty, to amend the Plan without any further action or consent of the Employer as the Prototype Document Sponsor deems either necessary for the purpose of adjusting the Plan to comply with all laws and regulations governing pension or proﬁ t sharing plans or desirable to the extent consistent with such laws and regulations. Speciﬁ cally, it is under-stood that the amendments may be made unilaterally by the Prototype Document Sponsor. However, it will be understood that the Prototype Document Sponsor will be under no obligation to amend the Plan documents, and the Employer expressly waives any rights or claims against the Prototype Document Sponsor for not exercising this power to amend. For purposes of Prototype Document Sponsor amendments, the mass submitter will generally be recognized as the agent of the Prototype Document Sponsor. If the Prototype Document Sponsor does not adopt IRS model amendments adopted by the mass submitter, the Plan will no longer be identical to or a minor modiﬁ er of the mass submitter plan and will be considered an individually designed plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, the adop-tion of good faith IRS amendments must be accomplished pursuant to the rules for each such amendment as prescribed by the IRS. However, for purposes of reliance on an opinion letter, the Prototype Document Sponsor will no longer have the authority to amend the Plan on behalf of the Employer as of the date the Employer amends the Plan to incorporate a type of plan that is not permitted under the prototype program, or as of the date the IRS notiﬁ es the Employer that the Plan is an individually designed plan due to the nature and extent of the Employer’s amendments to the Plan.2. An amendment by the Prototype Document Sponsor will be accom-plished by giving notice (either in writing or in any other form permit-ted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Adopting Employer of the amendment to be made. The notice will set forth the text of such amendment and the date such amendment is to be effective. Such amendment will take effect unless within the 30-day period after such notice is provided, or within such shorter period as the notice may specify, the Adopting Employer gives the Prototype Document Sponsor written notice of refusal to consent to the amendment. Such written notice of refusal will have the effect of withdrawing the Plan as a prototype plan and will cause the Plan to be considered an individually designed plan. 3. In addition to the amendment rights described above, the Prototype Document Sponsor will have the right to terminate its sponsorship of this Plan by providing notice (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Adopting Employer of such termination. Such termination of sponsor-ship will have the effect of withdrawing the Plan as a prototype plan and will cause the Plan to be considered an individually designed plan. The Prototype Document Sponsor will have the right to termi-nate its sponsorship of this Plan regardless of whether the Prototype Document Sponsor has terminated sponsorship with respect to other employers adopting its prototype Plan.B. Right of Adopting Employer to Amend the Plan—The Adopting Employer may amend the Plan to 1. change options previously selected in the Adoption Agreement; 2. add overriding language in the Adoption Agreement when such lan-guage is necessary to satisfy Code section 415 or Code section 416 because of the required aggregation of multiple plans;3. amend administrative provisions of the trust or custodial document in the case of a nonstandardized plan and make more limited amendments in the case of a standardized plan, such as the name of the Plan, Employer, Trustee or Custodian, Plan Administrator and other Fiduciaries, the trust year, and the name of pooled trust in which the Plan’s trust will participate;4. add certain sample and model amendments published by the IRS or other required good faith amendments, that speciﬁ cally provide that their adoption will not cause the Plan to be treated as individually designed; and5. add or change provisions permitted under the Plan or specify or change the Effective Date of a provision as permitted under the Plan.An Adopting Employer that amends the Plan for any other reason, includ-ing a waiver of the minimum funding requirement under Code section 412(d), will no longer participate in this prototype plan and will be con-sidered to have an individually designed plan.An Adopting Employer who wishes to amend the Plan shall document the amendment in writing, executed by a duly authorized ofﬁ cer of the Adopting Employer. If the amendment is in the form of a restated Adoption Agreement, the amendment will become effective on the date provided in the Adoption Agreement. Any other amendment will become effective as described therein upon execution by the Adopting Employer and, if appropriate, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). A copy of a restated Adoption Agreement or other amendment must be provided to the Prototype Document Sponsor and the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) before the effective date of the amendment.The Adopting Employer further reserves the right to replace the Plan in its entirety by adopting another retirement plan which the Adopting Employer designates as a replacement plan.C. Limitation on Power to Amend—No amendment to the Plan will be effective to the extent that it has the effect of decreasing a Participant’s accrued beneﬁ t. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Participant’s Individual Account may be reduced to the extent permit-ted under Code section 412(d)(2) or to the extent permitted under Treasury Regulations sections 1.411(d)-3 and 1.411(d)-4. For purposes of this paragraph, a Plan amendment that has the effect of decreasing a Participant’s Individual Account with respect to beneﬁ ts attributable to service before the amendment will be treated as reducing an accrued beneﬁ t. For purposes of this paragraph, a Participant will not accrue a right to an allocation of an Employer Proﬁ t Sharing Contribution or Employer Money Purchase Pension Contribution for the current Plan Year until the last day of such Plan Year and after the application of all amendments required or permitted by the IRS. No amendment to the Plan will be effective to eliminate or restrict an optional form of beneﬁ t. The preceding sentence will not apply to a Plan amendment that eliminates or restricts the ability of a Participant to receive payment of their Individual Account under a particular optional form of beneﬁ t if the amendment provides a single-sum distribution form. Where this Plan document is being adopted to amend another plan that contains a protected beneﬁ t not provided for in this document, the Employer must complete a “Protected Beneﬁ t and Prior Plan Document Provisions Attachment,” describing such protected beneﬁ t which, will become part of the Plan.7.07 Plan Merger or ConsolidationIn the case of any merger or consolidation of the Plan with, or transfer of assets or liabilities of such Plan to, any other plan, each Participant will be entitled to receive beneﬁ ts immediately after the merger, consolida-tion, or transfer (if the Plan had then terminated) that are equal to or greater than the beneﬁ ts they would have been entitled to receive imme-diately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the Plan had then terminated). The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) has the authority to enter into merger agreements or agreements to directly transfer the assets of this Plan, but only if such agreements are made with trustees or custodians of other retirement plans described in Code section 401(a) or such other plans permitted by laws or regulations. If it is later deter-mined that all or part of a non-elective transfer was ineligible to be transferred into the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any ineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto (deter-mined in the manner described in Plan Section7.02(B)), be returned to the transferor plan or correct the ineligible transfer using any other method permitted by the IRS under regulation or other guidance.\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1226-27 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Neither the Adoption Agreement nor the Plan nor any amendment or modiﬁ cation thereof nor the making of contributions hereunder will be construed as giving any Participant or any other person any legal or equitable right against the Employer, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), the Plan Administrator, or the Prototype Document Sponsor except as speciﬁ cally provided herein, or as provided by law.7.09 Method and Procedure for TerminationThe Plan may be terminated by the Adopting Employer at any time by appropriate action of its managing body. Such termination will be effec-tive on the date speciﬁ ed by the Adopting Employer. The Plan shall terminate, if required by either the IRS or the DOL, if the Adopting Employer is dissolved or terminated. Written notice of the termination and effective date thereof will be given to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), Plan Administrator, Prototype Document Sponsor, and the Participants and Beneﬁ ciaries of deceased Participants. The required ﬁ lings (such as the Form 5500 series and others) must be made by the Adopting Employer with the IRS and any other regulatory body as required by current laws and regulations. Until all of the assets have been distributed from the Fund, the Adopting Employer must keep the Plan in compliance with current laws and regulations by making appro-priate amendments to the Plan and by taking such other measures as may be required. If the Plan is abandoned by the Adopting Employer, however, a qualiﬁ ed termination administrator (QTA) (or other entity permitted by the IRS or DOL) may terminate the Plan according to rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, a reversion to the Employer of amounts contributed to the Plan that exceed the limitations imposed under Code section 415(c) may occur upon termination of the Plan according to rules promulgated by the IRS. 7.10 Continuance of Plan by Successor EmployerNotwithstanding the preceding Plan Section 7.09, a successor of the Adopting Employer may continue the Plan and be substituted in the place of the present Adopting Employer. The successor and the present Adopting Employer (or, if deceased, the executor of the estate of a deceased Self-Employed Individual who was the Adopting Employer) must execute a written instrument authorizing such substitution, and the successor shall amend the Plan in accordance with Plan Section 7.06.7.11 Failure of Plan Qualiﬁ cationIf the Plan fails to retain its qualiﬁ ed status, the Plan will no longer be considered to be part of a prototype plan, and such Employer can no longer participate under this prototype. In such event, the Plan will be considered an individually designed plan.7.12 Governing Laws and ProvisionsTo the extent such laws are not preempted by federal law, the terms and conditions of this Plan will be governed by the laws of the state in which the Prototype Document Sponsor is located, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Prototype Document Sponsor and the Employer.In the event of any conﬂ ict between the provisions of this Basic Plan Document and provisions of the Adoption Agreement, the summary plan description, or any related documents, the Basic Plan Document will control.7.13 State Community Property LawsThe terms and conditions of this Plan will be applicable without regard to the community property laws of any state.7.14 HeadingsThe headings of the Plan have been inserted for convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in any construction of the provisions hereof.7.15 Gender and NumberWhenever any words are used herein in the masculine gender, they will be construed as though they were also used in the feminine gender in all cases where they would so apply, and whenever any words are used herein in the singular form, they will be construed as though they were also used in the plural form in all cases where they would so apply.7.16 Standard of Fiduciary ConductThe Employer, Plan Administrator, Trustee, and any other Fiduciary under this Plan shall discharge their duties with respect to this Plan solely in the interests of Participants and their Beneﬁ ciaries, and with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims. No Fiduciary will cause the Plan to engage in any transaction known as a “non-exempt prohibited transaction” under either the Code or ERISA.7.17 General Undertaking of all PartiesAll parties to this Plan and all persons claiming any interest whatsoever hereunder agree to perform any and all acts and execute any and all documents and papers that may be necessary or desirable for the carrying out of this Plan and any of its provisions.7.18 Agreement Binds Heirs, Etc.This Plan shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns as those terms will apply to any and all parties hereto, present and future.7.19 Determination of Top-Heavy Status A. In General—Except as provided in Plan Section 7.19(B), this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan if any of the following conditions exist:1. if the top-heavy ratio for this Plan exceeds 60 percent and this Plan is not part of any Required Aggregation Group or Permissive Aggregation Group of plans;2. if this Plan is part of a Required Aggregation Group of plans but not part of a Permissive Aggregation Group and the top-heavy ratio for the group of plans exceeds 60 percent; or3. if this Plan is a part of a Required Aggregation Group and part of a Permissive Aggregation Group of plans and the top-heavy ratio for the Permissive Aggregation Group exceeds 60 percent.B. Top-Heavy Ratio1. If the Employer maintains one or more deﬁ ned contribution plans (including any simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan) and the Employer has not maintained any deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan that during the ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date(s) has or has had accrued beneﬁ ts, the top-heavy ratio for this Plan alone or for the Required or Permissive Aggregation Group as appropriate is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the account balances of all Key Employees as of the Determination Date(s) (including any part of any account balance distributed in the one-year period ending on the Determination Date(s) (ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002)) and the denominator of which is the sum of all account balances (including any part of any account balance distrib-uted in the one-year period ending on the Determination Date(s), (ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1228-29 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Both the numerator and the denominator of the top-heavy ratio are increased to reﬂ ect any contribution not actually made as of the Determination Date, but that is required to be taken into account on that date under Code section 416 and the corre-sponding regulations.2. If the Employer maintains one or more deﬁ ned contribution plans (including any simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan) and the Employer maintains or has maintained one or more deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans that during the ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date(s) has or has had any accrued beneﬁ ts, the top-heavy ratio for any Required or Permissive Aggregation Group, as appropriate, is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of account balances under the aggregated deﬁ ned contribution plan or plans for all Key Employees, determined in accordance with 1) above, and the Present Value of accrued beneﬁ ts under the aggregated deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan or plans for all Key Employees as of the Determination Date(s), and the denominator of which is the sum of the account balances under the aggregated deﬁ ned contribution plan or plans for all Participants, determined in accordance with 1) above, and the Present Value of accrued beneﬁ ts under the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan or plans for all Participants as of the Determination Date(s), all deter-mined in accordance with Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations. The accrued beneﬁ ts under a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan in both the numerator and denominator of the top-heavy ratio are increased for any distribution of an accrued beneﬁ t made in the one-year period ending on the Determination Date (ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002).3. For purposes of (1) and (2) above, the value of account balances and the Present Value of accrued beneﬁ ts will be determined as of the most recent Valuation Date that falls within or ends with the 12-month period ending on the Determination Date, except as pro-vided in Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations for the ﬁ rst and second plan years of a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan. The account balances and accrued beneﬁ ts of a Participant 1) who is not a Key Employee but who was a Key Employee in a prior year, or 2) who has not been credited with at least one Hour of Service with any employer maintaining the plan at any time during the one-year period (ﬁ ve-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002) ending on the Determination Date will be disregarded. The calculation of the top-heavy ratio, and the extent to which distributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken into account will be made in accordance with Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations. Deductible employee contributions will not be taken into account for purposes of computing the top-heavy ratio. When aggregating plans, the value of account balances and accrued beneﬁ ts will be calculated with reference to the Determination Dates that fall within the same calendar year. The accrued beneﬁ t of a Participant other than a Key Employee will be determined under 1) the method, if any, that uniformly applies for accrual purposes under all deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans maintained by the Employer, or 2) if there is no such method, as if such beneﬁ t accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under the fractional rule of Code section 411(b)(1)(C).7.20 Inalienability of Beneﬁ tsNo beneﬁ t or interest available under the Plan will be subject to assign-ment or alienation, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The preceding sen-tence will not apply to judgments and settlements described in Code section 401(a)(13)(C) and ERISA section 206(d)(4). Such sentence will, however, apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any beneﬁ t payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a Domestic Relations Order, unless such order is determined to be a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order as deﬁ ned in the Deﬁ nitions Section of the Plan.Generally, a Domestic Relations Order cannot be a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order until January 1, 1985. However, in the case of a Domestic Relations Order entered before January 1, 1985, the Plan Administrator:1. shall treat such order as a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order if the Plan Administrator is paying beneﬁ ts pursuant to such order on January 1, 1985; and2. may treat any other such order entered before January 1, 1985, as a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order even if such order does not meet the requirements of Code section 414(p). Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, a distribu-tion to an Alternate Payee under a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order will be permitted even if the Participant affected by such order is not otherwise entitled to a distribution, and even if such Participant has not attained the earliest retirement age as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(p).7.21 BondingEvery Fiduciary and every person who handles funds or other property of the Plan shall be bonded to the extent required by ERISA section 412 and the corresponding regulations for purposes of protecting the Plan against loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on the part of the person, group, or class, alone or in connivance with others, to be cov-ered by such bond. The amount of the bond will be ﬁ xed at the begin-ning of each Plan Year and will not be less than ten-percent of the amount of funds handled. The amount of funds handled will be deter-mined by the funds handled the previous Plan Year or, if none, the amount of funds estimated, in accordance with rules provided by the Secretary of Labor, to be handled during the current Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding, no bond will be less than $1,000 nor more than $500,000, except that the Secretary of Labor will have the right to prescribe an amount in excess of $500,000. In the case of a Plan that holds employer securities (within the meaning of ERISA sec-tion 407(d)(1)), the maximum bond amount is $1,000,000 or such other amount as the Secretary of Labor prescribes.7.22 Investment AuthorityA. Plan Investments—Except as provided in Plan Section 7.22(B) (relat-ing to individual direction of investments by Participants), the Adopting Employer, not the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), will have exclu-sive management and control over the investment of the Fund into any permitted investment. The Adopting Employer will be responsible for establishing a funding policy statement on behalf of the Plan and shall provide a copy of such funding policy statement to the Discretionary Trustee, if any. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Trustee is desig-nated as a Discretionary Trustee in the Adoption Agreement, such Discretionary Trustee may enter into an agreement with the Adopting Employer whereby the Discretionary Trustee will manage the investment of all or a portion of the Fund. Any such agreement will be in writing and will set forth such matters as the Discretionary Trustee deems neces-sary or desirable.B. Direction of Investments by Participants—Each Participant will have the responsibility for directing the Trustee (or Custodian, if provided for under a separate agreement between the Adopting Employer and the Custodian), regarding the investment of all or part of their Individual Account. If all of the requirements pertaining to Participant direction of investment in ERISA section 404(c)(1) are satisﬁ ed, then to the extent so directed, the Adopting Employer, Plan Administrator, Trustee, Custodian (if applicable), and all other Fiduciaries are relieved of Fiduciary liability under ERISA section 404. The Plan Administrator shall direct that a Separate Fund be established in the name of each Participant who directs the investment of part or all of their Individual Account. Each Separate Fund will be charged or cred-ited (as appropriate) with the earnings, gains, losses, or expenses attributable to such Separate Fund. No Fiduciary will be liable for any loss that results from a Participant’s individual direction. The assets subject to individual direction will not be invested in collectibles as that term is deﬁ ned in Code section 408(m). \\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1228-29 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Mgr.Maribeth McLarenFontsITC Franklin Gothic Std (Book, Me-dium, Demi; OpenType)GraphicsJanet LevyDETAILSJob TypeLithoMech Scale100%Output Size100%Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document 29The Plan Administrator shall establish such uniform and nondiscrimina-tory rules relating to individual direction as it deems necessary or advis-able including, but not limited to, rules describing 1) which portions of Participants’ Individual Accounts can be individually directed, 2) the frequency of investment changes, 3) the forms and procedures for making investment changes, and 4) the effect of a Participant’s failure to make a valid direction. The Plan Administrator may, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, limit the available investments for Participants’ individual direction to certain speciﬁ ed investment options (including, but not limited to, cer-tain mutual funds, investment contracts, deposit accounts, and group trusts). The Plan Administrator may permit, in a uniform and nondis-criminatory manner, a Beneﬁ ciary of a deceased Participant or the Alternate Payee under a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order to individu-ally direct investments in accordance with this Plan Section 7.22(B). Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, if the Adoption Agreement names a Directed Trustee, such Participants will furnish investment instruction to the Plan Administrator under procedures adopted by the Adopting Employer and/or the Plan Administrator consis-tent with the Plan, and it will be the responsibility of the Plan Administrator to provide direction to the Directed Trustee regarding the investment of such amounts. If a Participant who has the right to direct investments under the terms of the Plan fails to provide such direction to the Plan Administrator, the Plan Administrator shall direct the invest-ment of such Participant’s Individual Accounts. The Plan Administrator shall maintain records showing the interest of each Participant and/or Beneﬁ ciary in the Fund unless the Directed Trustee enters into a written agreement with the Adopting Employer to keep separate accounts for each such Participant or Beneﬁ ciary. C. Investment Managers1. Deﬁ nition of Investment Manager—The Adopting Employer may appoint one or more investment managers to make investment decisions with respect to all or a portion of the Fund. The invest-ment manager will be any ﬁ rm or individual registered as an invest-ment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a bank as deﬁ ned in said Act, or an insurance company qualiﬁ ed under the laws of more than one state to perform services consisting of the management, acquisition, or disposition of any assets of the Plan. 2. Investment Manager’s Authority—A separate Investment Fund will be established representing the assets of the Fund invested at the direction of the investment manager. The investment manager so appointed shall direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) with respect to the investment of such Investment Fund. The investments that may be acquired at the direction of the investment manager are those described in Plan Section 7.22(D). 3. Written Agreement—The appointment of any investment manager will be by written agreement between the Adopting Employer and the investment manager, and a copy of such agreement (and any modiﬁ -cation or termination thereof) must be given to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). The agreement will set forth, among other matters, the effective date of the investment manager’s appointment and an acknowledgment by the investment manager that it is a Fiduciary of the Plan under ERISA. 4. Concerning the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable)—Written notice of each appointment of an investment manager will be given to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of such appointment. Such notice will specify which portion of the Fund will constitute the Investment Fund subject to the investment manager’s direction. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will comply with the investment direction given to it by the investment manager and will not be liable for any loss which may result by reason of any action (or inaction) it takes at the direction of the investment manager.D. Permissible Investments—The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) may invest the assets of the Plan in property of any character, real or personal, including, but not limited to, the following: stocks, including Qualifying Employer Securities, and including shares of open-end invest-ment companies (mutual funds); bonds; notes; debentures; proprietary mutual funds; deposit accounts; options; limited partnership interests; mortgages; real estate or any interests therein (including Qualifying Employer Real Property); unit investment trusts; Treasury Bills, and other U.S. Government obligations; common trust funds, combined investment trusts, collective trust funds or commingled funds main-tained by a bank or similar ﬁ nancial organization (whether or not the Trustee hereunder); savings accounts, certiﬁ cates of deposit, demand or time deposits or money market accounts of a bank or similar ﬁ nan-cial organization (whether or not the Trustee hereunder); annuity con-tracts that are “guaranteed beneﬁ t policies,” as deﬁ ned in ERISA section 401(b)(2)(B); life insurance policies; or in such other invest-ments as is deemed proper without regard to investments authorized by statute or rule of law governing the investment of trust funds but with regard to ERISA and this Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Prototype Document Sponsor may, as a condition of making the Plan available to the Adopting Employer, limit the types of property in which the assets of the Plan may be invested. The list of permissible investment options will be further limited in accordance with any appli-cable law, regulations, or other restrictions applicable to the Trustee or Custodian, including, but not limited to, internal operational procedures adopted by such Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). The actions of a Discretionary Trustee named in the Adoption Agreement will also be subject to the funding policy statement provided by the Adopting Employer. If any Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) invests all or any portion of the Fund pursuant to written instructions provided by the Adopting Employer (including an investment manager appointed by the Adopting Employer pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(C)) or any Participant pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(B), the Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-cable) will be deemed to have invested pursuant to the Adopting Employer’s funding policy statement.To the extent the assets of the Plan are invested in a group trust, including a collective trust fund or commingled funds maintained by a bank or similar ﬁ nancial organization, the declaration of trust of such composite trust will be deemed to be a part of the Plan, and any invest-ment in such composite trust will be subject to all of the provisions of such declaration of trust, as the same may be amended or supple-mented from time to time.If the responsibility for directing investments for Elective Deferrals (and earnings) is executed by someone other than the Participants, the acqui-sition of Qualifying Employer Securities and Qualifying Employer Real Property will be limited to ten-percent of the fair market value of the assets of the Plan, to the extent required by ERISA section 407(b)(2). E. Matters Relating to Insurance1. Unless prohibited by the Plan Sponsor pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(D), a life insurance contract may be purchased on behalf of a Participant. No life insurance contract may be purchased unless the insured under the contract is the Participant, the Participant’s Spouse or another individual in whom the Participant has an insur-able interest. If a life insurance contract is to be purchased for a Participant, the aggregate premium for certain life insurance for each Participant must be less than a certain percentage of the aggregate Employer Contributions allocated to a Participant’s Individual Account at any particular time as follows. a. Ordinary Life Insurance—For purposes of these incidental insur-ance provisions, ordinary life insurance contracts are contracts with both nondecreasing death beneﬁ ts and nonincreasing premiums. If such contracts are purchased, less than 50 percent of the aggre-gate Employer Contributions allocated to any Participant’s Individual Account will be used to pay the premiums attributable to them. b. Term and Universal Life Insurance—No more than 25 percent of the aggregate Employer Contributions allocated to any Participant’s Individual Account will be used to pay the premiums on term life insurance contracts, universal life insurance contracts, and all other life insurance contracts that are not ordinary life.

Combination—The sum of 50 percent of the ordinary life insurance premiums and all other life insurance premiums will not exceed 25 percent of the aggregate Employer Contributions allocated to any Participant’s Individual Account. The above incidental beneﬁ ts limits do not apply to life insurance con-tracts (1) purchased by an Employee who has been a Participant in the Plan for ﬁ ve or more years, (2) purchased with Employer Contributions that have been in the Participant’s Individual Account for at least two full Plan Years, measured from the date such contributions were allo-cated or (3) purchased using rollover contributions. For purposes of this Plan Section 7.22(E)(1), transfer contributions will be considered Employer Contributions, and therefore may be used to pay contract premiums. No part of the Deductible Employee Contribution account will be used to purchase life insurance.2. Any dividends or credits earned on insurance contracts for a Participant will be allocated to such Participant’s Individual Account derived from Employer Contributions for whose beneﬁ t the contract is held. 3. Subject to Plan Section 5.10, the contracts on a Participant’s life will be converted to cash or an annuity or distributed to the Participant upon separation from service with the Employer. In addi-tion, contracts on the joint lives of a Participant and another person may not be maintained under this Plan if such Participant ceases to have an insurable interest in such other person. 4. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) shall apply for and will be the owner of any insurance contract(s) purchased under the terms of this Plan. The insurance contract(s) must provide that proceeds will be payable to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). However, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be required to pay over all proceeds of the contract(s) to the Participant’s Designated Beneﬁ ciary in accordance with the distribution provisions of this Plan. A Participant’s Spouse will be the designated beneﬁ ciary of the proceeds in all circumstances unless a Qualiﬁ ed Election has been made in accordance with Plan Section 5.10. Under no circumstances will the Fund retain any part of the proceeds. In the event of any conﬂ ict between the terms of this Plan and the terms of any insur-ance contract purchased hereunder, the Plan provisions will control. 5. The Plan Administrator may direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-cable) to sell and distribute insurance or annuity contracts to a Participant (or other party as may be permitted) in accordance with applicable law or regulations. 6. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, and except as may be otherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify and hold harmless the insurer, its ofﬁ cers, directors, employees, agents, heirs, executors, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements, losses, costs, charges, or expenses (including legal expenses) at any time arising out of or incurred in connection with any action taken by such par-ties in the performance of their duties with respect to this Plan, unless there has been a ﬁ nal adjudication of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties. Further, except as may be otherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify the insurer from any liability, claim, or expense (including legal expense) that the insurer incurs by reason of, or which results in whole or in part from, the reliance of the insurer on the facts and other directions and elections the Employer communicates or fails to communicate.F. Diversiﬁ cation Requirements When Employer Securities are Held as Investments in the Plan—For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2007, Code section 401(a)(35) requires qualiﬁ ed retirement plans that hold employer securities to allow Participants, Alternate Payees with Individual Accounts under the Plan, or Beneﬁ ciaries of deceased Participants to diversify their investments. This Code section and other relevant guidance govern the diversiﬁ cation procedures, which include the following.1. Employee Contributions and Elective Deferrals Invested in Employer Securities—In the case of the portion of an Individual Account attrib-utable to Nondeductible Employee Contributions and Elective Deferrals (if applicable) that are invested in employer securities, the Participant, Alternate Payee, or Beneﬁ ciary, as applicable, may elect to direct the Plan to divest any such securities and to reinvest an equivalent amount in other investments that meet the investment option requirements below. 2. Employer Contributions Invested in Employer Securities—In the case of the portion of an Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions other than Elective Deferrals that are invested in employer securities, a Participant who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), an Alternative Payee with respect to a Participant who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if appli-cable), or a Beneﬁ ciary, as applicable, may elect to direct the Plan to divest any such securities and to reinvest an equivalent amount in other investments that meet the investment option requirements below. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Plan provides for imme-diate vesting, the three years of service requirement will be satisﬁ ed on the day immediately preceding the third anniversary of the Participant’s date of hire.3. Investment Options—The diversiﬁ cation requirements above are met if the Plan offers not less than three investment options, other than employer securities, to which a Participant, Alternate Payee, or Beneﬁ ciary, as applicable may direct the proceeds from the divest-ment of employer securities, each of which is diversiﬁ ed and has materially different risk and return characteristics. The Plan may limit the time for divestment and reinvestment to periodic, reasonable opportunities that occur no less frequently than quarterly. Except as provided in regulations, the Plan must not impose employer securi-ties investment restrictions or conditions that are not imposed on the investment of other Plan assets (other than restrictions or condi-tions imposed by securities laws or other relevant guidance) except that a Plan may allow for more frequent transfers to or from either a stable value fund or a qualiﬁ ed default investment alternative.4. Exception for Certain Plans—The diversiﬁ cation requirement does not apply to a one-Participant retirement plan, an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) if 1) there are no contributions or earnings in the ESOP that are held within such plan and that are subject to Code sections 401(k) or (m), and 2) such plan is a separate plan for purposes of Code section 414(l) with respect to any other deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plan or deﬁ ned contribution plan maintained by the same employer or employers, or to a retirement plan where employer securities are held in an investment fund as described in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(35)-1(f)(2)(B)(3)(ii). 5. Transition Rule for Securities Attributable to Employer Contributions—In the case of the portion of an Individual Account attributable to Employer Contributions other than Elective Deferrals that are invested in employer securities, including, a Participant who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), an Alternate Payee with respect to a Participant who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), or a Beneﬁ ciary, as appli-cable, the employer securities acquired in a Plan Year beginning before January 1, 2007, will be subject to the following divestiture and reinvestment transition schedule, which applies separately with respect to each class of securities.  For the Plan Year in which diversiﬁ cation requirement applies, the applicable percentage subject to diversiﬁ cation is: • First   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  33%• Second .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  66%• Third   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   100% This three-year phase-in requirement does not apply to a Participant who has attained age 55 and who has completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable) before the ﬁ rst Plan Year beginning after December 31, 2005.\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1230-31 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

To the extent provided in any Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order, the former Spouse of a Participant will be treated as a surviving Spouse of such Participant for purposes of any beneﬁ t payable in the form of either a Qualiﬁ ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualiﬁ ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity.B. The Plan will not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of the Code, which generally prohibits payment of beneﬁ ts before the Participant’s Termination of Employment or Severance from Employment, as applicable, with the Employer, solely by reason of payments to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order.C. In the case of any Domestic Relations Order received by the Plan: 1. the Plan Administrator shall promptly notify the Participant and any other Alternate Payee of the receipt of such order and the Plan’s procedure for determining the qualiﬁ ed status of Domestic Relations Orders; and 2. within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the Plan Administrator shall determine whether such order is a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order and notify the Participant and each Alternate Payee of such determination.The Plan Administrator shall establish reasonable procedures to deter-mine the qualiﬁ ed status of Domestic Relations Orders and to adminis-ter distributions under such qualiﬁ ed orders.D. During any period in which the issue of whether a Domestic Relations Order is a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order is being determined by the Plan Administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, the Plan Administrator shall segregate in a separate account in the Plan or in an escrow account the amounts which would have been payable to the Alternate Payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order. If within 18 months the order or modiﬁ cation thereof is determined to be a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order, the Plan Administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (plus any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto. If within 18 months either 1) it is determined that the order is not a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order, or 2) the issue as to whether such order is a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order is not resolved, then the Plan Administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (plus any inter-est thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order. Any determination that an order is a Qualiﬁ ed Domestic Relations Order that is made after the close of the 18-month period will be applied prospectively only.7.24 Indemniﬁ cation of Prototype Document Sponsor Notwithstanding any other provision herein, and except as may be other-wise provided by ERISA, the Employer shall indemnify and hold harm-less the Prototype Document Sponsor, its ofﬁ cers, directors, employees, agents, heirs, executors, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements, losses, costs, charges, or expenses (including legal expenses) at any time arising out of or incurred in connection with any action taken by such parties in the performance of their duties with respect to this Plan, unless there has been a ﬁ nal adjudication of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such duties. Further, except as may be otherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify the Prototype Document Sponsor from any liability, claim, or expense (including legal expense) that the Prototype Document Sponsor incurs by reason of, or which results in whole or in part from, the reliance of the Prototype Document Sponsor on the facts and other directions and elections the Employer, Plan Administrator, or Investment Fiduciary communicates or fails to communicate.7.25 Military ServiceNotwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, beneﬁ ts, and service credit with respect to qualiﬁ ed military service will be provided in accordance with Code section 414(u), including, but not limited to the following.A. Beneﬁ t Accrual in the Case of Death or Disability Resulting from Active Military Service.1. Beneﬁ t Accrual—If elected in the Adoption Agreement, for beneﬁ t accrual purposes, an individual who dies or becomes disabled while performing qualiﬁ ed military service (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(u)) will be treated as if the individual resumed employment in accordance with the individual’s reemployment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), on the day preceding death or Disability (as appli-cable) and terminated employment on the actual date of death or Disability. If the Employer elects to treat an individual as having resumed employment as described above, subject to items (2) and (3) below, any full or partial compliance by the Plan with respect to the beneﬁ t accrual requirements will be treated for purposes of Code section 414(u)(1) as if such compliance were required under USERRA. 2. Nondiscrimination Requirement—Part A, item (1) above will only apply if all individuals performing qualiﬁ ed military service with respect to the Employer (as determined under Code sections 414(b), (c), (m), and (o)) who die or became disabled as a result of perform-ing qualiﬁ ed military service (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(u)) before reemployment by the Employer are credited with service and beneﬁ ts on reasonably equivalent terms.3. Determination of Beneﬁ ts—The amount of Nondeductible Employee Contributions and the amount of Elective Deferrals of an Employee treated as reemployed under Part A, item (1) for purposes of apply-ing Code section 414(u)(8)(C) will be determined on the basis of the individual’s average actual Nondeductible Employee Contributions or Elective Deferrals for the lesser ofa. the 12-month period of service with the Employer immediately before qualiﬁ ed military service (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(u)), orb. if service with the Employer is less than such 12-month period, the actual length of continuous service with the Employer.B. Vesting in the Case of Disability Resulting from Active Military Service1. Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable)—If elected in the Adoption Agreement, for vesting purposes, an indi-vidual who becomes disabled while performing qualiﬁ ed military service (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(u)) will be treated as if the individual resumed employment in accordance with the individual’s reemployment rights under USERRA, on the day preceding Disability (as applicable) and terminated employment on the actual date of Disability. If the Employer elects to treat an individual as having resumed employment as described above, subject to item (2) below, compliance by the Plan with respect to the vesting requirements will be treated for purposes of Code section 414(u)(1) as if such compli-ance were required under USERRA.2. Nondiscrimination Requirements—Part B, item (1) above will apply to the extent permitted under other applicable rules, including the rules provided in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3), which provides nondiscrimination rules for crediting imputed service. Under Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3), the provisions crediting vesting service to any Highly Compensated Employee must apply on the same terms to all similarly situated non-Highly Compensated Employees. C. Death Beneﬁ ts—In the case of an individual Participant who dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing qualiﬁ ed military service (as deﬁ ned in Code section 414(u)), the Participant’s survivors are entitled to any additional beneﬁ ts (other than beneﬁ t accruals relating to the period of qualiﬁ ed military service) provided under the Plan had the Participant resumed employment with the Employer and then terminated employment on account of death.Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1232-33 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The Adopting Employer represents and warrants to the entity that it has all requisite right, power, and authority and has taken all required actions necessary under the Plan and applicable law to designate the ﬁ nancial organization as Custodian of the Plan pursuant to the terms of the Basic Plan Document. The Employer, Plan Administrator, any Trustee, any other Investment Fiduciary, and the Custodian so appointed will be bound by all the terms of this Basic Plan Document and Adoption Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision hereof regarding the responsibilities of or granting powers to the Custodian, the Custodian will serve as a nondiscretionary, directed Custodian of the Fund, will have no discretionary authority with respect to the management or administration of the Plan or the Fund, and will act only as directed by the entity or individual who has such authority. A. Responsibilities of the Custodian—The Custodian’s responsibilities may be further limited by the Plan Trustee(s) and, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, may also be further limited by the terms of a separate agreement between the Custodian and the Adopting Employer. Subject to the previous sentence, the responsibilities of the Custodian will be limited to the following.1. To receive Plan contributions and to hold, invest and reinvest, and distribute the Fund as authorized by the Adopting Employer or its designee without distinction between principal and interest; pro-vided, however, that nothing in this Plan will require the Custodian to maintain physical custody of stock certiﬁ cates (or other indicia of ownership of any type of asset) representing assets within the Fund.2. To maintain accurate records of contributions, investments, earn-ings, receipts, disbursements, withdrawals, and other transactions with respect to the Fund, and all accounts, books, and records relating thereto will be open at all reasonable times to inspection and audit by any person designated by the Employer; provided, however, that the Custodian is given reasonable advance notice of such inspection by the Employer. On direction of the Adopting Employer or Plan Administrator, and if agreed to in writing by the Custodian, the Custodian may provide annual or interim account-ings, valuations, or other reports concerning the assets of the custodial account subject to payment of all required additional fees for such reports. The Custodian’s accounting will be at the Custodial Account level rather than the Participant level, and the Custodian will not be responsible for Participant-level record-keep-ing, reporting, or communication unless it agrees to do so in a separate written agreement with the Adopting Employer or Plan Administrator. The Custodian will also furnish the Adopting Employer with such other information as the Custodian possesses and which is necessary for the Adopting Employer to comply with the reporting requirements of ERISA, as applicable. An accounting will be deemed to have been approved by the Adopting Employer unless the Adopting Employer or Plan Administrator objects to the contents of an accounting within sixty (60) days of its mailing or electronic transmission by the Custodian. Any objections must set forth the speciﬁ c grounds on which they are based. Upon approval, the Custodian will be forever released from any and all liability with respect to the Account.3. To make disbursements from the Fund to Participants or Beneﬁ ciaries upon the proper authorization of the Plan Administrator.4. To furnish to the Plan Administrator an annual statement that reﬂ ects the value of the investments in the custody of the Custodian as of the end of the period and as of any other times as the Custodian and Plan Administrator may agree to in writing, including an agreement regarding the application of additional fees for such additional report.5. To invest the Fund only in investment options selected by the Investment Fiduciary. Such selection will be made from among the types of property that the Prototype Document Sponsor makes available in Plan Section 7.22(D). Notwithstanding the ﬁ rst sentence of Section 7.22(D), the Prototype Document Sponsor and not the Custodian is responsible for choosing to make such investments available for investment and for determining the fair market value of each such investment, and the Custodian has determined only that it is functionally and operationally willing and able to provide its services hereunder with respect thereto. The Investment Fiduciary will be responsible for ensuring compliance with all conditions, limitations, and restrictions concerning investment in any invest-ment option. The Custodian shall place monies or other property received by it in such permitted investments as the Custodian will be directed from time to time by instructions of the Investment Fiduciary (or Participant, if applicable) provided to it. If Participant direction in Plan Section 7.22(B) has been selected, the investment instructions of the Participants will be aggregated and delivered to the Custodian by the Plan Administrator or its agent. In the absence of Participant direction, the investment instructions of the appropri-ate Investment Fiduciary will be delivered to the Custodian by the Plan Administrator or its agent. The Custodian may hold the assets attributable to the Fund in omnibus accounts with assets of other retirement plans for which the Custodian serves as custodian or trustee. Nothing herein will preclude the Investment Fiduciary from otherwise investing any Plan assets as permitted by the Plan, but the Custodian will not be Custodian or Trustee thereof or have any duties or responsibilities with respect thereto.6. The Custodian is not obligated to place orders for the investment of the Fund if sufﬁ cient cash is not available in the Fund for use in placing such orders. The Custodian is authorized, but is not obli-gated, to advance funds or to arrange for another ﬁ nancial organiza-tion (which may be an afﬁ liate of the Custodian) to advance funds from time to time for the purchase of investment assets, for distribu-tions from the Fund and for other purposes before receipt of suf-ﬁ cient funds (whether contributions or proceeds of the liquidation of other investments). All such advances will be made subject to the requirements of ERISA and the rules, regulations, rulings, and inter-pretations thereunder, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 80-26, as amended from time to time. If sufﬁ cient funds to repay any such advance are not received by the following business day, the Custodian may, in its discretion, then or at any time thereafter before such repayment, sell, redeem, or otherwise liquidate any assets of the Fund in order to repay such advance. Any gain realized upon such liquidation, after payment of any related costs and expenses, will belong to the Plan. The Employer shall reimburse the Custodian on demand for any portion of any such advance and the related costs and expenses not repaid from the proceeds of the liquidation.7. The Custodian shall keep such portion of the Fund in cash or cash balances as may be directed from time to time by the applicable Investment Fiduciary. The Custodian will not be liable for any interest on any cash balances so maintained nor for interest on any cash or cash balances maintained in the Fund pending investment in accor-dance with appropriate directions. Monies being transferred to and disbursed by the Custodian may be held in non-interest bearing transaction accounts in ﬁ nancial organizations selected by the Custodian (which may be afﬁ liates of the Custodian) for purposes of collections and processing transfers and disbursements. The Custodian may transfer monies from the Fund to such accounts before issuance of wire transfer orders or checks, drafts, or other instruments payable from such accounts. The Custodian will not exercise its powers in Plan Section 8.01(B)(1) except pursuant to the instructions of the Investment Fiduciary transmitted to the Custodian.8. Should the Investment Fiduciary instruct the Custodian to use the services of any broker, dealer, employee, or representative of either, or any other person (“Broker”) to render services to the Fund, or should the Custodian require the services of such persons in order to fulﬁ ll its obligations pursuant to the Plan, the applicable Investment Fiduciary will be solely responsible for the selection or \\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1232-33 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

The Custodian shall fully comply with the writ-ten instructions, if of a continuing nature, until revoked.9. In connection with payments and disbursements made from the Fund for any purpose, the Custodian shall be responsible for issuing checks or drafts to such parties and for such amounts as the Plan Administrator will instruct. The Custodian will be fully protected in making such payments pursuant to such instructions from time to time and will be charged with no responsibility whatsoever respect-ing the purposes or propriety of such payments or the application of such monies.10. The Custodian shall provide any materials received by it relating to voting securities to the applicable Investment Fiduciary, which will be responsible for voting securities or arranging for such securities to be voted in accordance with the Plan and applicable law. It is understood that the Custodian will exercise the powers described in Plan Section 8.01(B) only pursuant to instructions of the Investment Fiduciary transmitted to the Custodian.11. The Custodian shall determine or have determined the value of the Fund as of each Valuation Date. The Custodian shall rely exclu-sively upon, and will not be responsible for, share and unit values established by third parties, or unit values established by the Custodian in its capacity as a mutual fund recordkeeper, transfer agent, or Custodian to the extent that the Custodian establishes such unit values in reliance on third-party information, including, but not limited to:a. in connection with mutual funds, the net asset value reported to the Custodian by such mutual funds or the transfer or other agents of such mutual funds or any generally recognized pricing service;b. in connection with bank collective funds, the unit value as reported by the trustee of such funds or its agent;c. in connection with policies and contracts with insurance companies or other ﬁ nancial institutions, the book value or other value ascribed to such policies or contracts by the insurance company or its agent or other ﬁ nancial organization or its agent; andd. in connection with publicly traded securities, the market price of such securities as reported to the public in a generally available form. The Custodian will have no liability from the failure or delay of any pricing source to provide a valuation as of any Valuation Date. If values for any investment of the Fund are not generally available, the Custodian shall rely upon instructions provided to it by the applicable Investment Fiduciary as to valuation procedures. With respect to the portion of the Fund that is invested by an investment manager or other named ﬁ duciary, the Custodian may conclusively rely upon the value of any securities or other property in that portion of the custo-dial account as reported to the Custodian by the investment man-ager or other named ﬁ duciary, for all purposes hereunder. 12. All records maintained by the Custodian with respect to the Fund will be held for such period as may be required under applicable law. Upon the expiration of any such required retention period, the Custodian will have the right to destroy such records. The Custodian will have the right to preserve all records and accounts in original form, electronically, or on microﬁ lm, magnetic tape, or any other similar process pursuant to applicable federal law and subsequent rules promulgated by the IRS or DOL.13. Except as provided below, the Custodian will conclusively presume that the Employer, Trustee, Plan Administrator, or other responsible party has made all ﬁ lings required by law as of the date required. Should the Custodian incur any liability by reason of any party’s failure to timely ﬁ le, the Employer shall indemnify and hold the Custodian, any parent, subsidiary, related corporation, or afﬁ liate of the Custodian, including their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employees, and agents harmless for any and all liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees), and other obligations, including penalties and interest, incurred by the Custodian. Notwithstanding the provisions of Plan Section 5.11, in connection with the disbursement of assets from the Fund to a Participant, the Custodian shall withhold and remit to the IRS and other applicable taxing authorities the amount of any income tax withholding required by law pursuant to instructions provided by the Plan Administrator.14. Except for the disbursement of loan proceeds and reinvestment of loan payments pursuant to instructions received hereunder, under no circumstances will the Custodian have or be allocated any responsibility for the administration of any Participant loan program in Plan Section 5.14.B. Powers of the Custodian—Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, and subject to receipt of instructions from the Adopting Employer, Plan Administrator, or Investment Fiduciary, as appropriate, the Custodian will have the power, but, in the absence of proper direction as provided in Plan Section 8.01(A) above, not the duty to take any action with respect to the Fund which it deems necessary or advisable to discharge its responsibili-ties under this Plan including, but not limited to, the following powers.1. To invest all or a portion of the Fund (including idle cash balances) in time deposits, savings accounts, money market accounts, or similar investments bearing a reasonable rate of interest in the Custodian’s own savings department or the savings department of another ﬁ nancial organization;2. To vote upon any stocks, bonds, or other securities; to give general or special proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to exercise any conversion privileges or subscription rights and to make any payments incidental thereto; to oppose, or to consent to, or otherwise participate in, corporate reorganizations or other changes affecting corporate securities, and to pay any assessment or charges in connection therewith; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, securities, or other property;3. To hold securities or other property of the Fund in its own name, in the name of its nominee (as allowed under Department of Labor Regulation section 2550.403a-1(b)), or in bearer form; and4. To make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all documents of transfer and conveyance and any and all other instruments that may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the powers herein granted.8.02 TrusteeThis Plan Section 8.02 applies when either a ﬁ nancial organization has and/or one or more individuals have, indicated in the Adoption Agreement that it will serve as Trustee with respect to all or a portion of the assets of the Fund. The responsibilities and powers of the Trustee may not be expanded except with its prior written consent and, notwith-standing any provision hereof to the contrary, may be further limited by the terms of a separate agreement between the Trustee and the Adopting Employer. Notwithstanding any provision hereof regarding the responsibilities of or granting powers to the Trustee, a Directed Trustee will have no discretionary authority with respect to the management or administration of the Plan or the Fund, and is subject to the proper and lawful directions of the Plan Administrator, who has authority with respect to receipt of the Plan’s assets. A. Responsibilities of the Trustee—The responsibilities of the Trustee will be limited to the following duties.1. To receive Plan contributions and to hold, invest, and reinvest the portion of the Fund for which it serves as Trustee, as authorized by the Employer or its designee, without distinction between principal and interest; provided, however, that nothing in this Plan will require the Trustee to maintain physical custody of stock certiﬁ cates (or other indicia of ownership) representing assets within the Fund;2.

Generally to do all such acts, execute all such instruments, initiate such proceedings, and exercise all such rights and privileges with relation to property constituting the Fund as if the Trustee were the absolute owner thereof, and, to the extent not inconsistent with the express provisions hereof, the enumeration of any power herein will not be by way of limitation, but will be cumulative and construed as full and complete power in favor of the Trustee. In addition to the authority speciﬁ cally herein granted, the Trustee will have such power to do all acts as may be deemed necessary for full and complete management of the Fund and appropriate to carry out the purposes of the Fund, and will further have all powers and authorities conferred on trustees by the laws of the Trustee’s domiciliary state. 8.03 Compensation and ExpensesThe Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will receive such reasonable compensation as may be agreed upon by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and the Adopting Employer. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be entitled to reimbursement by the Employer for all proper expenses incurred in carrying out their duties under this Plan, including reasonable legal, accounting, and actuarial expenses. Such compensation will include any earnings on funds retained pursuant to Plan Sections 8.01(A)(7) and 8.02(B)(19) hereof in non-interest bearing accounts and any such earnings will not become a part of the Fund. The Adopting Employer expressly acknowledges that the ability of the Trustee or the Custodian, as applicable, and any afﬁ liated ﬁ nancial organization of the preceding, to earn income on amounts held in such non-interest bearing accounts has been taken into consideration in establishing the Trustee’s or Custodian’s fees hereunder. If not paid by the Employer, all such compensation and expenses may be charged against the Fund. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Participant will not be entitled to compensation even if they serve in the capacity as a Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be reimbursed by the Employer or from the Fund for all taxes of any kind whatsoever that may be levied or assessed under existing or future laws of any jurisdiction upon or in respect of the Fund. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) shall promptly notify the Employer with regard to any levies or tax assessments that it receives on any income or property maintained in the Fund and, unless notiﬁ ed to the contrary by the Employer within ninety (90) days, shall pay any such levies or assessments. If the Employer notiﬁ es the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) within said period that it is its opinion or the opinion of counsel that such levies or assessments are invalid or that they should be contested, then the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) shall take whatever action concern-ing payment of the levy or assessment as is indicated in the notice received by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable); provided, however, that the Employer, and not the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), will be responsible for contesting any such levies or assessments or litigat-ing any such claims.8.04 No Obligation to Question DataThe Employer shall furnish the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and Plan Administrator the information which each party deems necessary for the administration of the Plan including, but not limited to, changes in a Participant’s status, eligibility, mailing addresses and other such data as may be required. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and Plan Administrator will be entitled to act on such information as is supplied to them and will have no duty or responsibility to further verify or question such information.8.05 ResignationAny person serving as Trustee or Custodian may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Adopting Employer. The resignation will become effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice unless a shorter period is agreed upon. If the Adopting Employer fails to appoint a successor Trustee or Custodian following notice of resignation, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will have the power to appoint a successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).The Adopting Employer may remove any Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-cable) at any time by giving written notice to such Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and such removal will be effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice unless a shorter period is agreed upon. The Adopting Employer will have the power to appoint a successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). In the event the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) is removed, resigns, dies, or becomes incapacitated and the Adopting Employer or Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not or cannot appoint a succes-sor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) within a reasonable period of time thereafter, a majority of Participants in the Plan will have the authority to appoint a successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) but will not be obligated to do so if engaging a majority of Participants would result in unreasonable time, expense, or administrative burden. Upon such resignation or removal, if the resigning or removed Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) is the sole Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), they shall transfer all of the assets of the Fund then held by such Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) as expeditiously as possible to the successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) after paying or reserving such reasonable amount as they will deem necessary to provide for the expense in the settlement of the accounts and the amount of any com-pensation due them and any sums chargeable against the Fund for which they may be liable. If the Funds as reserved are not sufﬁ cient for such purpose, then they will be entitled to reimbursement from the successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) out of the assets in the successor Trustee’s (or Custodian’s, if applicable) hands under this Plan. If the amount reserved will be in excess of the amount actually needed, the former Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will return such excess to the successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).Upon receipt of the transferred assets, the successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will thereupon succeed to all of the powers and responsibilities given to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) by this Plan.Where a ﬁ nancial organization is serving as Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and it is merged with or bought by another organization (or comes under the control of any federal or state agency), that organiza-tion shall serve as the successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) of this Plan, but only if it is the type of organization that can so serve under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or any subsequent assignees may, by prior written notice to the Employer, and without the need for the Employer’s consent or prior approval, assign all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Plan to any afﬁ liate (which term includes, without limitation, any parent, subsidiary, or sister entity) of the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or the assignee.Where the Trustee or Custodian is serving as a nonbank trustee or custo-dian pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.408-2(e), the Adopting Employer will appoint a successor Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) upon notiﬁ cation by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that such Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1236-37 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Any instruc-tions hereunder may be delivered to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) directly by the responsible party or by other mutually agreed upon parties.

A Directed Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will have no duty to inquire into the purpose or propriety of any order, instruction, or other communication received hereunder and may conclusively presume that any such order, instruc-tion, or other communication is accurate and complete. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not be responsible for determining that all instructions provided to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) are being given by the appropriate party and are in proper form under the provisions of the Plan and applicable law.

The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not be responsible for the validity or effect or the qualiﬁ cation under the Code or the Plan. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not be required to take any action upon receipt of any notice from the IRS or other taxing authority (unless such notice relates to the performance of the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) responsibilities in Plan Sections 8.01(A) or 8.02(A)) except to promptly forward a copy thereof to the Employer. Further, it is speciﬁ cally understood that the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will have no duty or responsibility with respect to the deter-mination of matters pertaining to the eligibility of any Employee to become a Participant or remain a Participant hereunder, the amount of beneﬁ t to which a Participant or Beneﬁ ciary will be entitled to receive hereunder, whether a distribution to Participant or Beneﬁ ciary is appro-priate under the terms of the Plan, the size and type of any policy to be purchased from any insurer for any Participant hereunder, or any other similar matters, it being understood that all such responsibilities under the Plan are vested in the Plan Administrator.8.07 Indemniﬁ cation of Trustee and CustodianNotwithstanding any provision hereof, the Adopting Employer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), and its afﬁ liates, and their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employees, agents, and other representatives harmless from any losses, costs, expenses, fees, liabilities, damages, claims, suits, or actions and appeals thereof resulting from their reliance upon any certiﬁ cate, notice, conﬁ rmation, or instruction purporting to have been delivered by a representative of the Adopting Employer or the Plan that has been duly identiﬁ ed to the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable) in a manner required or accepted by such Trustee (or Custodian, as appli-cable) (“Designated Representative”). The Adopting Employer waives any and all claims of any nature it now has or may have against the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable) and its afﬁ liates, and their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employees, agents, and other representa-tives, which arise, directly or indirectly, from any action that it takes in good faith in accordance with any certiﬁ cate, notice, conﬁ rmation, or instruction from a Designated Representative of the Adopting Employer. The Adopting Employer also hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), and any parent, subsid-iary, related corporation, or afﬁ liates of the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), including their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employees, agents, and other representatives, harmless from and against any and all loss, costs, damages, liability, expenses, or claims of any nature whatsoever, including but not limited to legal expenses, court costs, legal fees, and costs of investigation, including appeals thereof, arising, directly or indirectly, out of any loss or diminution of the Fund resulting from changes in the market value of the Fund assets; reliance, or action taken in reliance, on instructions from the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; any exercise or failure to exercise investment direction authority by the Adopting Employer or by its Designated Representative; the Trustee’s or Custodian’s refusal on advice of counsel to act in accordance with any investment direction by the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; any other act or failure to act by the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; any prohibited transaction or plan disqualiﬁ cation of a Qualiﬁ ed Plan due to any actions taken or not taken by the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), in reliance on instructions from the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; or any other act the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), takes in good faith hereunder that arises under the Plan or the administration of the Fund. The Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable), will not be liable to the Adopting Employer for any act, omission, or determination made in connection with this Agreement except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the preceding, the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable) will not be liable for any losses arising from its compliance with instructions from the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; for executing, failing to execute, failing to timely execute, or for any mistake in the execution of any instructions, unless such action or inaction is by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee (or Custodian, as applicable). The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be accountable only for monies or property actually received by it. If any portion of the Fund is held by another custodian or trustee, the term “Fund” herein will mean only that portion of the Fund from time to time held by the applicable Trustee or Custodian. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not be deemed accountable, responsible, or liable for the acts or omissions of any other custodian or trustee of the Plan. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will have no duty or responsibility for the determination of the accuracy or sufﬁ ciency of the contributions to be made under the Plan, the collection thereof, the transmittal of the same to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), or compliance with any statute, regulation, or rule applicable to such contributions. A Directed Trustee (or a Custodian, if applicable) will have no discretion as to investment of the Fund or administration of the Plan and will not be deemed a “ﬁ duciary” as that term is used in ERISA. The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) is signing the Adoption Agreement solely to signify its acceptance of appointment as Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) and the Employer will have sole responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, legal sufﬁ ciency, and due execution thereof, including consulting with legal counsel and tax advi-sors as the Employer deems appropriate in connection therewith.The provisions of this Plan Section 8.07 will survive the termination or amendment of the Plan. 8.08 MiscellaneousA. Governing Law—To the extent not preempted by ERISA, Plan Sections 8.01 and 8.02 will be construed and enforced, to the extent possible, according to the laws of the State in which the Custodian or Trustee maintains its principle place of business and all provisions hereof will be administered according to the laws of said State and any federal laws, regulations, or rules that may from time to time be applicable.B. Necessary Parties—To the extent permitted by law, only the Employer and the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be necessary parties in any application to the courts for an interpretation of Plan Sections 8.01 or 8.02 or for an accounting by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), and no other Plan Fiduciary, Participant, Beneﬁ ciary, or other person having an interest in the Fund will be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any ﬁ nal judgment entered in such an action or proceeding will, to the extent permitted by law, be conclusive upon all persons claiming in Plan Sections 8.01 or 8.02.\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1236-37 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

Force Majeure—The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will not be responsible or liable for the failure or delay in performance of its obliga-tions arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, or that could not be avoided by the exercise of due care, such as an act of God or any mechanical, elec-tronic, or communications failure.D. Agents—In performing its obligations under this Plan, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be entitled to employ suitable agents, counsel, sub-custodians, and other service providers.8.09 Limited TrusteeThis section applies where either a ﬁ nancial organization and/or one or more individuals has/have indicated in the Adoption Agreement that it will serve as Limited Trustee with respect to the Fund or where one or more individuals has/have indicated in the Adoption Agreement that they will serve as individual trustee(s) and a separate Limited Trustee(s) has not been indicated on the Adoption Agreement. At no time will a ﬁ nancial organization that is serving as a Trustee be considered a Limited Trustee without their express authorization shown by its signa-ture on either the Adoption Agreement or a separate form approved by the ﬁ nancial organization. The responsibilities and powers of the Limited Trustee may not be expanded except with its prior written consent and, notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, may be further limited by the terms of a separate agreement between the Limited Trustee and the Adopting Employer. A. Responsibilities of the Limited TrusteeNotwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the responsibilities of the Limited Trustee will be limited to ensuring the timely collection and deposit of Employer Contributions.B. Compensation and ExpensesThe Limited Trustee will receive such reasonable compensation as may be agreed upon by the Limited Trustee and the Adopting Employer. The Limited Trustee will be entitled to reimbursement by the Employer for all proper expenses incurred in carrying out their duties under this Plan, including reasonable legal, accounting, and actuarial expenses. If not paid by the Employer, all such compensation and expenses may be charged against the Fund. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Participant will not be entitled to compensation even if they serve in the capacity as a Limited Trustee.C. No Obligation to Question DataThe Plan Administrator and/or Employer shall furnish to the Limited Trustee the information that the Limited Trustee deems necessary for complying with its responsibilities under the Plan. The Limited Trustee will be entitled to act on such information as is supplied and will have no duty or responsibility to further verify or question such information.D. ResignationAny person serving as Limited Trustee may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) days advance written notice to the Adopting Employer. The resignation will become effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice unless a shorter period is agreed upon. The Adopting Employer may remove any Limited Trustee at any time by giving written notice to such Limited Trustee and such removal will be effective thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice unless a shorter period is agreed upon. The Adopting Employer will have the power and the duty to appoint a succes-sor Limited Trustee. If the Adopting Employer fails to appoint a succes-sor Limited Trustee following notice of resignation, the Trustee will have the power, but not the duty, to appoint a successor Limited Trustee. In no event will the Trustee become a Limited Trustee unless the Trustee acknowledges the appointment by executing the Limited Trustee section of the Adoption Agreement.Where a ﬁ nancial organization is serving as Limited Trustee and it is merged with or bought by another organization (or comes under the control of any federal or state agency), that organization will serve as the successor Limited Trustee of this Plan, but only if it is the type of organization that can so serve under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Limited Trustee or any subsequent assignees may, by prior written notice to the Employer, and without the need for the Employer’s consent or prior approval, assign all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Plan to any afﬁ liate (which term includes, without limitation, any parent, subsidiary, or sister entity) of the Limited Trustee or the assignee.E. Degree of Care—Limitations of LiabilityThe Limited Trustee will be under no duty to take any action other than its express responsibilities under this Plan unless the responsible party under the terms of the Plan shall furnish the Limited Trustee with writ-ten instructions; provided that in no event may the Limited Trustee’s responsibilities be expanded except with its prior written consent. Any instructions hereunder may be delivered to the Limited Trustee directly by the responsible party or by other mutually agreed upon parties. The Limited Trustee will not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in reliance upon any instructions received hereunder or any other notice, request, consent, certiﬁ cate, or other instrument or paper reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been properly exe-cuted. The Limited Trustee will not be responsible for determining that all instructions provided to the Limited Trustee are being given by the appropriate party and are in proper form under the provisions of the Plan and applicable law. The Limited Trustee may conclusively presume that any instructions received have been duly authorized by the Employer, Plan Administrator, or Discretionary Trustee, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and applicable law. The Limited Trustee will not be responsible for the validity or effect or the qualiﬁ ca-tion under the Code or the Plan. F. Indemniﬁ cation of Limited TrusteeNotwithstanding any provision hereof, the Adopting Employer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Limited Trustee, and its afﬁ liates, and their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employees, agents, and other representatives harmless from any losses, costs, expenses, fees, liabilities, damages, claims, suits, or actions and appeals thereof resulting from their reliance upon any certiﬁ cate, notice, conﬁ rmation, or instruction purporting to have been delivered by a representative of the Adopting Employer or the Plan that has been duly identiﬁ ed to the Limited Trustee in a manner required or accepted by such Limited Trustee. The Adopting Employer waives any and all claims of any nature it now has or may have against the Limited Trustee and its afﬁ liates, and their respective directors, managers, ofﬁ cers, employ-ees, agents, and other representatives, which arise, directly or indi-rectly, from any action or act the Limited Trustee takes in good faith hereunder that arises under the Plan or the administration of the Fund. The Limited Trustee will not be liable to the Adopting Employer for any act, omission, or determination made in connection with this Agreement except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the preceding, the Limited Trustee will not be liable for any losses arising from its compliance with instructions from the Adopting Employer or its Designated Representative; for executing, failing to execute, failing to timely execute, or for any mistake in the execution of any instructions, unless such action or inaction is by rea-son of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Limited Trustee The Limited Trustee is signing the Adoption Agreement solely to signify its acceptance of appointment as Limited Trustee and the Employer will have sole responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, legal sufﬁ ciency, and due execution thereof, including consulting with legal counsel and tax advisors as the Employer deems appropriate in connection therewith.The provisions of this Plan Section 8.09 will survive the termination or amendment of the Plan.Section Nine: Adopting Employer SignatureAdoption Agreement Section Nine must contain the signature of an autho-rized representative of the Adopting Employer evidencing the Employer’s agreement to be bound by the terms of the Basic Plan Document, Adoption Agreement, and, if applicable, separate trust or custodial agreement.Section 1\\x0cItem #REG47279-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-1238 of 40Spellcheck: NoColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 1:17 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

This opinion relates only to the acceptability of the form of the plan under the Internal Revenue Code. It is not an opinion of the effect of other Federal or local statutes.You must furnish a copy of this letter, a copy of the approved plan, and copies of any subsequent amendments to each employer who adopts this plan. Effective on or after 10/31/2011, interim amendments adopted by the sponsor on behalf of employers must provide the date of adoption by the sponsor.This letter considers the changes in qualiﬁ cation requirements contained in the 2010 Cumulative List of Notice 2010-90, 2010-52 I.R.B. 909.Our opinion on the acceptability of the form of the plan is not a ruling or determination as to whether an employer’s plan qualiﬁ es under Code section 401(a). The employer can generally rely on the letter as described in Rev. Proc. 2011-49, 2011-44 I.R.B. 608, provided the terms of the plan are followed in operation.Our opinion does not apply for purposes of Code section 401(a)(10)(B) and section 401(a)(16) if an employer ever maintained another qualiﬁ ed plan for one or more employees who are covered by this plan. For this purpose, the employer will not be considered to have maintained another plan merely because the employer has maintained another deﬁ ned contribution plan(s), provided such other plan(s) has been terminated prior to the effective date of this plan and no annual additions have been credited to the account of any participant under such other plan(s) as of any date within the limitation year of this plan. Also, for this purpose, an employer is considered as maintaining another plan, to the extent that the employer maintains a welfare beneﬁ t fund deﬁ ned in Code section 419(e), which provides postretirement medical beneﬁ ts allocated to separate accounts for key employees as deﬁ ned in Code section 419A(d)(3), or an individual medical account as deﬁ ned in Code section 415(l)(2), which is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the employer, or a simpliﬁ ed employee pension plan.An employer that adopts this plan may not rely on this opinion letter with respect to: (1) whether any amendment or series of amendments to the plan satisﬁ es the nondiscrimination requirements of section 1.401(a)(4)-5(a) of the regulations, except with respect to plan amendments granting past service that meet Letter 433327Section 2\\x0cItem #REG47331-01.inddJob #Page #CS21566-152 of 2Spellcheck: YesColor Seps: NoFold Dummy: NoRound5Last Modiﬁ ed11-14-2014 2:34 PMTEAMStudioPrev.

L. 104-199, 110 Stat. 2419 (DOMA) or U.S. v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 12 (2013), which invalidated that section.The employer may request a determination (1) as to whether the plan, considered with all related qualiﬁ ed plans and, if appropriate, welfare beneﬁ t funds, individual medical beneﬁ t accounts, and simpliﬁ ed employee pension plans, satisﬁ es the requirements of Code section 401(a)(16) as to limitations on beneﬁ ts and contributions in Code section 415 and the requirements of Code section 401(a)(10)(B) as to the top-heavy plan requirements in Code section 416; (2) with respect to whether a money purchase or target beneﬁ t plan’s normal retirement age which is earlier than age 62 satisﬁ es the requirements of section 401(a)-1(b)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations; (3) that the plan is a multiple employer plan; (4) whether there has been a partial termination; and (5) to comply with published procedures of the Service (e.g. minimum funding waiver request). The employer may request a determination letter in these circumstances by ﬁ ling an application with Employee Plans Determinations on Form 5300, without restating for the Cumulative List in effect when the application is ﬁ led.If you, the master or prototype sponsor, have any questions concerning the IRS processing of this case, please call the above telephone number.

1) the amount of Employer Contributions actually paid to the \\nFund on behalf of such Participant for the Plan Year to 2) the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nCompensation for such Plan Year. For purposes of calculating the ADP, \\nEmployer Contributions on behalf of any Participant will include: 1) any \\nElective Deferrals (other than Catch-up Contributions) made pursuant to \\nthe Participantâ\\x80\\x99s salary deferral election or pursuant to automatic Elective \\nDeferral enrollment, if applicable (including Excess Elective Deferrals of \\nHighly Compensated Employees), but excluding Excess Elective Deferrals \\nof Participants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees that arise \\nsolely from Elective Deferrals made under the Plan or plans of this \\nEmployer. For purposes of computing Actual Deferral Percentages, an \\nEmployee who would be a Participant but for the failure to make Elective \\nDeferrals will be treated as a Participant on whose behalf no Elective \\nDeferrals are made.\\n\\nAdopting Employer \\nMeans any corporation, sole proprietor, or other entity named in the \\nAdoption Agreement and any successor who by merger, consolidation, \\npurchase, or otherwise assumes the obligations of the Plan.

The payment is regular compensation for services during the \\n\\nEmployeeâ\\x80\\x99s regular working hours, or compensation for services \\noutside the Employeeâ\\x80\\x99s regular working hours (such as overtime \\nor shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar \\npayments; and\\n\\nb.  The payment would have been paid to the Employee prior to a \\nSeverance from Employment if the Employee had continued in \\nemployment with the Employer.\\n\\n3.  Leave Cashouts. An amount is described in this paragraph (3) if \\n\\na.  The payment is for unused accrued bona ï¬\\x81 de sick, vacation, or \\n\\nother leave, but only if the Employee would have been able to use \\nthe leave if employment had continued.\\n\\n4.  Deferred Compensation. An amount is described in this paragraph (4) if \\n\\na.  The payment is an amount received by an Employee pursuant to a \\nnonqualiï¬\\x81 ed unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the \\npayment would have been paid to the Employee at the same time if \\nthe Employee had continued in employment with the Employer and \\nonly to the extent that the payment is includible in the Employeeâ\\x80\\x99s \\ngross income.\\n\\n5.

In \\naddition, the Plan will not be treated as failing to meet the requirements \\nof any provision described in Code section 414(u)(1)(C) by reason of any \\ncontribution or beneï¬\\x81 t that is based on Differential Wage Payments only if \\nall Employees of the Employer (as determined under Code sections \\n414(b), (c), (m), and (o)) performing service in the uniformed services \\ndescribed in Code section 3401(h)(2)(A) are entitled to receive Differential \\nWage Payments on reasonably equivalent terms and, if eligible to partici-\\npate in the Plan, to make contributions based on the payments on rea-\\nsonably equivalent terms applying the provisions of Code section 410(b)\\n(3), (4), and (5).

Exception for Certain Paymentsâ\\x80\\x94A Domestic Relations Order will not \\nbe treated as failing to meet the requirements above solely because such \\norder requires that payment of beneï¬\\x81 ts be made to an Alternate Payee\\n\\n1.  on or after the date on which the Participant attains (or would have \\n\\nattained) the earliest retirement age as deï¬\\x81 ned in Code section \\n414(p)(4)(B),\\n\\n2.  as if the Participant had retired on the date on which such payment \\n\\nis to begin under such order, and \\n\\n3.  in any form in which such beneï¬\\x81 ts may be paid under the Plan to the \\nParticipant (other than in a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity) with \\nrespect to the Alternate Payee and their subsequent spouse. \\n\\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Election \\nMeans a waiver of a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed \\nPreretirement Survivor Annuity.

If it is established to the satisfac-\\ntion of a Plan representative that there is no Spouse or that the Spouse \\ncannot be located, a waiver by the Participant will be deemed a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed \\nElection. In addition, if the Spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, \\nthe Spouseâ\\x80\\x99s legal guardian, even if the guardian is the Participant, may \\ngive consent. If the Participant is legally separated or the Participant has \\nbeen abandoned (within the meaning of local law) and the Participant has \\na court order to such effect, spousal consent is not required unless a \\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order provides otherwise. \\n\\nAny consent by a Spouse obtained under this provision (or establishment \\nthat the consent of a Spouse may not be obtained) will be effective only \\nwith respect to such Spouse.

The percentage of the survivor annuity under the Plan \\nwill be 50 percent.\\n\\nsingle annuity for the life of the Participant. If the survivor annuity pro-\\nvided by the Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is less than 75 percent \\nof the annuity payable during the joint lives of the Participant and the \\nSpouse, the applicable percentage is 75 percent. If the survivor annuity \\nprovided by the Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is greater than or \\nequal to 75 percent, the applicable percentage is 50 percent.\\n\\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity\\nMeans a survivor annuity for the life of the surviving Spouse of the \\nParticipant if the payments are not less than the amounts that would be \\npayable as a survivor annuity under the Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor \\nAnnuity under the Plan in accordance with Code section 417(c). \\n\\nQualifying Employer Real Property \\nMeans parcels of Employer real property that are subject to the require-\\nments of ERISA section 407.\\n\\nQualifying Employer Security(ies) \\nMeans stock that is issued by the Employer and transferred to this Plan \\nand that is subject to the requirements of ERISA section 407 and meets \\nthe requirements of ERISA section 407(d)(5).\\n\\nQualifying Participant\\nA Participant is a Qualifying Participant and is entitled to share in the \\nEmployer Contribution for any Plan Year if the Participant was a \\nParticipant on at least one day during the Plan Year and either completes \\nmore than 500 Hours of Service during the Plan Year or is employed on \\nthe last day of the Plan Year.

A transaction under Code \\nsection 410(b)(6)(C) is an asset or stock acquisition, merger, or similar \\ntransaction involving a change in the employer of the employees of a \\ntrade or business.\\n\\n2.02 Plan Entry\\n\\nA.  Plan Restatementâ\\x80\\x94If this Plan is an amendment or restatement of a \\nPrior Plan Document, each Employee who was a Participant under the \\nPrior Plan Document before the Effective Date will continue to be a \\nParticipant in this Plan.\\n\\nB.  Effective Dateâ\\x80\\x94If this is an initial adoption of the Plan by the \\nEmployer, an Employee will become a Participant in the Plan as of the \\nEffective Date if the Employee has met the eligibility requirements of \\nPlan Section 2.01 as of such date. After the Effective Date, each \\nEmployee will become a Participant on the ï¬\\x81 rst Entry Date coinciding \\nwith or following the date the Employee satisï¬\\x81 es the eligibility require-\\nments of Plan Section 2.01 for the applicable contribution source.\\n\\nC.  Notiï¬\\x81 cationâ\\x80\\x94The Plan Administrator shall notify each Employee who \\nbecomes eligible to be a Participant under this Plan and shall furnish \\nthe Employee with the enrollment forms or other documents that are \\nrequired of Participants. Such notiï¬\\x81 cation will be in writing, or in any \\nother form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS or DOL. The \\nEmployee will execute such forms or documents and make available \\nsuch information as may be required in the administration of the Plan. \\n\\n2.03 Transfer to or from an Ineligible Class\\n\\nIf an Employee who had been a Participant becomes ineligible to partici-\\npate because they are no longer a member of an eligible class of \\nEmployees, but has not incurred a Break in Eligibility Service, such \\n\\nIndividual 401(k) Basic Plan Document  11\\n\\n\\x0cEmployee will participate immediately following the date of reemploy-\\nment upon their return to an eligible class of Employees. If such \\nEmployee incurs a Break in Eligibility Service, their eligibility to partici-\\npate will be determined by Plan Section 2.04. \\n\\nAn Employee who is not a member of the eligible class of Employees \\nwill become a Participant immediately upon becoming a member of the \\neligible class, provided such Employee has satisï¬\\x81 ed the age and eligibil-\\nity service requirements. If such Employee has not satisï¬\\x81 ed the age \\nand eligibility service requirements as of the date they become a mem-\\nber of the eligible class, such Employee will become a Participant on \\nthe ï¬\\x81 rst Entry Date coinciding with or following the date they satisfy \\nthose requirements. \\n\\n2.04 Return as a Participant After a Break in Eligibility Service\\n\\nA.  Employee Not a Participant Before Breakâ\\x80\\x94If an Employee incurs a \\nBreak in Eligibility Service before satisfying the Planâ\\x80\\x99s eligibility require-\\nments, such Employeeâ\\x80\\x99s eligibility service before such Break in Eligibility \\nService will not be taken into account. \\n\\nB.  Employee a Participant Before Breakâ\\x80\\x94If a Participant incurs a Break \\nin Eligibility Service, such Participant will continue to participate in the \\nPlan, or, if terminated, will participate immediately following the date of \\nreemployment. \\n\\n2.05 Determinations Under This Section\\n\\nThe Plan Administrator will determine the eligibility of each Employee to \\nbe a Participant. This determination will be conclusive and binding upon \\nall persons except as otherwise provided herein or by law. \\n\\n2.06 Terms of Employment\\n\\nNothing with respect to the establishment of the Plan and trust or any \\naction taken with respect to the Plan, nor the fact that a common law \\nEmployee has become a Participant will give to that Employee any right \\nto employment or continued employment or to grant any other rights \\nexcept as speciï¬\\x81 cally set forth in this Plan document, ERISA, or other \\napplicable law; nor will the Plan or trust limit the right of the Employer \\nto discharge an Employee or to otherwise deal with an Employee with-\\nout regard to the effect such treatment may have upon the Employeeâ\\x80\\x99s \\nrights under the Plan. \\n\\nSection Three: Contributions\\n\\n3.01 Elective Deferrals\\n\\nEach Employee who satisï¬\\x81 es the eligibility requirements speciï¬\\x81 ed in the \\nAdoption Agreement may begin making such Elective Deferrals to the \\nPlan by enrolling as a Contributing Participant.\\n\\nA.  Requirements to Enroll as a Contributing Participantâ\\x80\\x94Each Employee \\nwho satisï¬\\x81 es the eligibility requirements speciï¬\\x81 ed in the Adoption \\nAgreement, may enroll as a Contributing Participant, on the ï¬\\x81 rst Entry \\nDate coinciding with or following the date the Employee satisï¬\\x81 es the \\neligibility requirements, or if applicable, the ï¬\\x81 rst Entry Date following the \\ndate on which the Employee returns to the eligible class of Employees \\npursuant to Plan Section 2.03. A Participant who wishes to enroll as a \\nContributing Participant must deliver (either in writing or in any other \\nform permitted by the IRS and the DOL) a salary reduction agreement to \\nthe Plan Administrator. Except for occasional, bona ï¬\\x81 de administrative \\nconsiderations as set forth in the Treasury Regulations, contributions \\nmade pursuant to such election cannot precede the earlier of 1) the \\ndate on which services relating to the contribution are performed, and 2) \\nthe date on which the Compensation that is subject to the election \\nwould be payable to the Employee in the absence of an election to defer. \\n\\nIf a Plan permits both Pre-Tax and Roth Elective Deferrals and the \\nParticipant fails to designate whether their Elective Deferrals are Pre-Tax \\nor Roth Elective Deferrals, the Participant will be deemed to have desig-\\nnated the Elective Deferrals as Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals.\\n\\nThe Employer shall deposit Elective Deferrals with the Trustee (or \\nCustodian, if applicable) as of such time as is required by the IRS and DOL.\\n\\nB.  Ceasing Elective Deferralsâ\\x80\\x94A Participant may cease Elective \\nDeferrals and thus withdraw as a Contributing Participant as of any \\nsuch times established by the Plan Administrator in a uniform and \\nnondiscriminatory manner by revoking the authorization to the Employer \\nto make Elective Deferrals on their behalf. A Participant who desires to \\nwithdraw as a Contributing Participant will give notice of withdrawal to \\nthe Plan Administrator at least 30 days (or such shorter period as the \\nPlan Administrator will permit in a uniform and nondiscriminatory man-\\nner) before the effective date of withdrawal. A Participant will cease to \\nbe a Contributing Participant upon their Termination of Employment or \\non account of termination of the Plan. \\n\\nC.  Return as a Contributing Participant After Ceasing Elective \\nDeferralsâ\\x80\\x94A Participant who has withdrawn as a Contributing \\nParticipant (e.g., pursuant to Plan Section 3.01(B), a suspension due to \\na hardship distribution, or a suspension due to a distribution on \\naccount of a Deemed Severance from Employment) may not again \\nbecome a Contributing Participant such times established by the Plan \\nAdministrator in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.\\n\\nD.  Changing Elective Deferral Amountsâ\\x80\\x94A Contributing Participant or a \\nParticipant who has met the eligibility requirements in the Adoption \\nAgreement, but who has never made an afï¬\\x81 rmative election regarding \\nElective Deferrals, may complete a new or modify an existing salary \\nreduction agreement to increase or decrease the amount of their \\nCompensation deferred into the Plan or change the type of their future \\nElective Deferrals (Roth or Pre-Tax), if applicable. Such modiï¬\\x81 cation may \\nbe made as of such times established by the Plan Administrator in a \\nuniform and nondiscriminatory manner. A modiï¬\\x81 cation that results in the \\namount of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Compensation being deferred into the Plan \\nbeing zero (0) will be considered a cessation of deferrals under the Plan. \\nA Contributing Participant who desires to make such a modiï¬\\x81 cation will \\ncomplete and deliver (either in writing or in any other form permitted by \\nthe IRS and the DOL) a new salary reduction agreement. The Plan \\nAdministrator may prescribe such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules as \\nit deems appropriate to carry out the terms of this Plan Section 3.01(D).\\n\\nE.  Pre-Tax Vs. Roth Elective Deferralsâ\\x80\\x94If the Adopting Employer so \\nelects in the Adoption Agreement, each Employee who enrolls as a \\nContributing Participant may specify whether their Elective Deferrals are \\nto be characterized as Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals, Roth Elective Deferrals, \\nor a speciï¬\\x81 ed combination. A Contributing Participantâ\\x80\\x99s election will \\nremain in effect until superseded by another election. Elective Deferrals \\ncontributed to the Plan as one type, either Roth or Pre-Tax, may not later \\nbe reclassiï¬\\x81 ed as the other type. A Contributing Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Roth \\nElective Deferrals will be deposited in the Contributing Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Roth \\nElective Deferral subaccount in the Plan. No contributions other than \\nRoth Elective Deferrals and properly attributable earnings will be credited \\nto each Contributing Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Roth Elective Deferral account, and \\ngains, losses, and other credits or charges will be allocated on a reason-\\nable and consistent basis to such subaccount.\\n\\nF.  Catch-up Contributionsâ\\x80\\x94All Employees who are eligible to make \\nElective Deferrals under this Plan and who are age 50 or older by the \\nend of their taxable year will be eligible to make Catch-up Contributions. \\nCatch-up Contributions are not subject to the limits on Annual Additions \\nunder Code section 415, are not counted in the ADP test, and are not \\ncounted in determining the minimum allocation under Code section 416 \\n(but Catch-up Contributions made in prior years are counted in determin-\\ning whether the Plan is top-heavy). Provisions in the Plan relating to \\nCatch-up Contributions apply to Elective Deferrals made after 2001.\\n\\n3.02 Employer Contributions\\n\\nA.  Obligation to Contributeâ\\x80\\x94The Employer may contribute an amount to \\nbe determined from year to year. The Employer may, in its sole discre-\\ntion, make contributions without regard to current or accumulated earn-\\nings or proï¬\\x81 ts. \\n\\nB.  Allocation Formula and the Right to Share in the Employer Contribution \\n\\n1.  Generalâ\\x80\\x94Employer Proï¬\\x81 t Sharing Contributions will be allocated to \\nall Qualifying Participants using a pro rata allocation formula. Under \\nthe pro rata allocation formula, Employer Proï¬\\x81 t Sharing Contributions \\nwill be allocated to the Individual Accounts of Qualifying Participants \\n\\n12 Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document\\n\\n\\x0cin the ratio that each Qualifying Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Compensation for the \\nPlan Year bears to the total Compensation of all Qualifying \\nParticipants for the Plan Year. The Employer Contribution for any Plan \\nYear will be deemed allocated to each Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual \\nAccount as of the last day of that Plan Year.', 'Any Employer Contribution for a Plan Year must satisfy Code sec-\\ntion 401(a)(4) and the corresponding Treasury Regulations for such \\nPlan Year.\\n\\n2.  Special Rule for Owner-Employeesâ\\x80\\x94If this Plan provides contribu-\\n\\ntions or beneï¬\\x81 ts for one or more Owner-Employees, contributions on \\nbehalf of any Owner-Employee may be made only with respect to the \\nEarned Income of such Owner-Employee.\\n\\n3.  Inclusion of Ineligible Employeesâ\\x80\\x94If any Employee who is not a \\n\\nQualifying Participant is erroneously treated as a Qualifying \\nParticipant during a Plan Year, then, except as otherwise provided in \\nPlan Section 3.02(F), the Employer will not be eligible to receive any \\nportion of the contribution erroneously allocated to the Individual \\nAccount of the ineligible Employee. The Employer must correct the \\ninclusion of ineligible employees using any method permitted under \\nthe Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) or \\nallowed by the IRS or DOL under regulations or other guidance. \\nEPCRS is currently described in IRS Revenue Procedure 2013-12.\\n\\n4.  Exclusion of Eligible Participantâ\\x80\\x94If in any Plan Year, any Participant is \\n\\nerroneously excluded and discovery of such exclusion is not made \\nuntil after the Employer Contribution has been made and allocated, \\nthen the Employer must contribute for the excluded Participant the \\namount, including earnings thereon, that the Employer should have \\ncontributed for the Participant. The Employer must correct the exclu-\\nsion of eligible Participants using any method permitted under EPCRS \\nor allowed by the IRS or DOL under regulations or other guidance. \\nEPCRS is currently described in IRS Revenue Procedure 2013-12.\\n\\nC.  Allocation of Forfeituresâ\\x80\\x94A Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account shall be \\nnonforfeitable and 100 percent vested at all times. \\n\\nD.  Timing of Employer Contributionâ\\x80\\x94Unless otherwise speciï¬\\x81 ed in the \\nPlan or permitted by law or regulation, the Employer Contribution made \\nby an Employer for each Plan Year will be deposited with the Trustee (or \\nCustodian, if applicable) not later than the due date for ï¬\\x81 ling the \\nEmployerâ\\x80\\x99s income tax return for its tax year in which the Plan Year \\nends, including extensions thereof. Notwithstanding the preceding, \\nEmployer Contributions may be deposited during the Plan Year for which \\nthey are being made.\\n\\nE.  Minimum Allocation for Top-Heavy Plansâ\\x80\\x94The contribution and allo-\\ncation provisions of this Plan Section 3.02(E) will apply for any Plan \\nYear with respect to which this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan and will super-\\nsede any conï¬\\x82 icting provisions in the Plan. \\n\\n1.  Except as otherwise provided in (3) and (4) below, the Employer \\n\\nContributions allocated on behalf of any Participant who is not a Key \\nEmployee will not be less than the lesser of three-percent of such \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s Compensation or (in the case where the Employer does \\nnot maintain a deï¬\\x81 ned beneï¬\\x81 t plan in addition to this Plan that desig-\\nnates this Plan to satisfy Code section 401 the largest percentage of \\nEmployer Contributions, as a percentage of the Key Employeeâ\\x80\\x99s \\nCompensation, as limited by Code section 401(a)(17), allocated on \\nbehalf of any Key Employee for that year. The minimum allocation is \\ndetermined without regard to any Social Security contribution. Only \\nParticipants who are not Key Employees will be entitled to receive the \\nminimum allocation. For purposes of the preceding sentences, the \\nlargest percentage of Employer Contributions as a percentage of \\neach Key Employeeâ\\x80\\x99s Compensation will be determined by treating \\nElective Deferrals as Employer Contributions. This minimum allocation \\nwill be made even though under other Plan provisions, the Participant \\nwould not otherwise be entitled to receive an allocation.\\n\\n2.  For purposes of computing the minimum allocation, Compensation will \\nmean compensation as provided in the Deï¬\\x81 nitions Section of the Plan \\nas limited by Code section 401(a)(17) and will include any amounts \\ncontributed by the Employer pursuant to a salary reduction agreement \\nand that is not includible in gross income under Code sections \\n\\n402(g), 125, 132(f)(4), or 457. Compensation for the full Determin-\\nation Year will be used in calculating the minimum allocation. \\n\\n3.  The provision in (1) above will not apply to any Participant who was \\n\\nnot employed by the Employer on the last day of the Plan Year. \\n\\n4.  The minimum allocation required under this Plan Section 3.02(E) (to \\nthe extent required to be nonforfeitable under Code section 416(b)) \\nmay not be forfeited under Code sections 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D).\\n\\nS\\ne\\nc\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n\\n5.  Elective Deferrals (and for Plan Years beginning before 2002, \\n\\nMatching Contributions) may be taken into account for purposes of \\nsatisfying the minimum allocation requirement applicable to Top-\\nHeavy Plans described in Plan Section 3.02(E)(1). \\n\\nF.  Return of the Employer Contribution to the Employer Under Special \\nCircumstancesâ\\x80\\x94Any contribution made by the Employer because of a \\nmistake of fact must be returned to the Employer within one year of \\nthe contribution. \\n\\nIn the event that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determines that \\nthe Plan is not initially qualiï¬\\x81 ed under the Code, any contributions made \\nincident to that initial qualiï¬\\x81 cation by the Employer must be returned to \\nthe Employer within one year after the date the initial qualiï¬\\x81 cation is \\ndenied, but only if the application for qualiï¬\\x81 cation is made by the time \\nprescribed by law for ï¬\\x81 ling the Employerâ\\x80\\x99s return for the taxable year in \\nwhich the Plan is adopted, or such later date as the Secretary of the \\nTreasury may prescribe. \\n\\nIn the event that a contribution made by the Employer under this Plan is \\nconditioned on deductibility and is not deductible under Code section 404, \\nthe contribution, to the extent of the amount disallowed, must be returned \\nto the Employer within one year after the deduction is disallowed. \\n\\nIf applicable, no contract will be purchased under the Plan unless such \\ncontract or a separate deï¬\\x81 nite written agreement between the Employer \\nand the insurer provides that no value under contracts providing ben-\\neï¬\\x81 ts under the Plan or credits determined by the insurer (on account of \\ndividends, earnings, or other experience rating credits, or surrender or \\ncancellation credits) with respect to such contracts may be paid or \\nreturned to the Employer or diverted to or used for other than the exclu-\\nsive beneï¬\\x81 t of the Participants or their Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries. However, any \\ncontribution made by the Employer because of a mistake of fact must \\nbe returned to the Employer within one year of the contribution.\\n\\n3.03 Rollover Contributions\\n\\nAn Employee may make Indirect Rollover and Direct Rollover contribu-\\ntions to the Plan from distributions made from plans described in Code \\nsections 401(a), 403(a), 403(b), 408, and 457(b) (if maintained by a \\ngovernmental entity) (excluding nondeductible employee contributions) \\nunless an Employee is a member of any excluded class pursuant to Plan \\nSection 2.01. The Plan Administrator may require the Employee to cer-\\ntify, either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promul-\\ngated by the IRS and DOL, that the contribution qualiï¬\\x81 es as a rollover \\ncontribution under the applicable provisions of the Code. If it is later \\ndetermined that all or part of a rollover contribution was ineligible to be \\ncontributed to the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any \\nineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto (deter-\\nmined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be distributed \\nfrom the Plan to the Employee as soon as administratively feasible.\\n\\nA separate account will be maintained by the Plan Administrator for each \\nEmployeeâ\\x80\\x99s rollover contributions, which will be nonforfeitable at all \\ntimes. Such account will share in the income and gains and losses of \\nthe Fund in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B). The Employer \\nmay, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, allow only Employees \\nwho have become Participants in the Plan to make rollover contributions. \\n\\n2009 RMDs and Extended 2009 RMDs distributed for 2009 were con-\\nsidered Eligible Rollover Distributions and could have been rolled over to \\nthe Plan in accordance with this section.\\n\\nIndividual 401(k) Basic Plan Document  13\\n\\n\\x0c3.04 Transfer Contributions\\n\\nThe Adopting Employer may, subject to uniform and nondiscriminatory \\nrules, permit elective transfers to be delivered to the Trustee (or \\nCustodian, if applicable) in the name of an Employee from the trustee \\nor custodian of another plan qualiï¬\\x81 ed under Code section 401(a). \\nWhether any particular elective transfer will be accepted by the Plan will \\nbe determined using the uniform and nondiscriminatory rules estab-\\nlished by the Plan Administrator, and the procedures for the receipt of \\nsuch transfers by the Plan must be allowed under Code section 411(d)\\n(6), Treasury Regulation section 1.411(d)-4, and other rules promulgated \\nby the IRS. Nothing in this Plan prohibits the Plan Administrator from \\npermitting (or prohibiting) Participants to transfer their Individual \\nAccounts to other eligible plans, provided such transfers are permitted \\n(or prohibited) in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. If it is later \\ndetermined that all or part of an elective transfer was ineligible to be \\ntransferred into the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any \\nineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto (deter-\\nmined in the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B)), be distributed \\nfrom the Plan to the Employee as soon as administratively feasible. \\nNotwithstanding the preceding, the Employer may, at its discretion, also \\nreturn the amount transferred to the transferor plan or correct the \\nineligible transfer using any other method permitted by the IRS under \\nregulation or other guidance.\\n\\nA separate account will be maintained by the Plan Administrator for \\neach Employeeâ\\x80\\x99s elective transfers, which will, if applicable, be \\nnonforfeitable at all times. Such account will share in the income and \\ngains and losses of the Fund in the manner described in Plan Section \\n7.02(B). If elective transfers are associated with distributable events \\nand the Employees are eligible to receive single sum distributions con-\\nsisting entirely of Eligible Rollover Contributions, the elective transfers \\nwill be considered Direct Rollovers.\\n\\n3.05 Limitation on Allocations\\n\\nA.  If the Participant does not participate in, and has never participated \\nin, another qualiï¬\\x81 ed plan maintained by the Employer, a welfare beneï¬\\x81 t \\nfund (as deï¬\\x81 ned in Code section 419(e)) maintained by the Employer, an \\nindividual medical account (as deï¬\\x81 ned in Code section 415(l)(2)) main-\\ntained by the Employer, or a simpliï¬\\x81 ed employee pension plan (as \\ndeï¬\\x81 ned in Code section 408(k)) maintained by the Employer, any of \\nwhich provides an Annual Addition as deï¬\\x81 ned in the Deï¬\\x81 nitions Section \\nof the Plan, the following rules will apply. \\n\\n1.  The amount of Annual Additions that may be credited to the \\n\\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account for any Limitation Year will not \\nexceed the lesser of the Maximum Permissible Amount or any other \\nlimitation contained in this Plan. If the Employer Contribution that \\nwould otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nIndividual Account would cause the Annual Additions for the \\nLimitation Year to exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount, the \\namount contributed or allocated may be reduced so that the Annual \\nAdditions for the Limitation Year will equal the Maximum Permissible \\nAmount. \\n\\n2.  Before determining the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s actual Compensation for the \\n\\nLimitation Year, the Employer may determine the Maximum \\nPermissible Amount for a Participant on the basis of a reasonable \\nestimate of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Compensation for the Limitation Year, \\nuniformly determined for all Participants similarly situated. \\n\\n3.  As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the \\n\\nLimitation Year, the Maximum Permissible Amount for the Limitation \\nYear will be determined on the basis of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s actual \\nCompensation for the Limitation Year. \\n\\n4.  Any Excess Annual Additions allocated to a Participant may be cor-\\nrected through EPCRS or such other correction method allowed by \\nstatute, regulations, or regulatory authorities. EPCRS is currently \\ndescribed in IRS Revenue Procedure 2013-12.\\n\\nB.  If, in addition to this Plan, the Participant is covered under another \\nqualiï¬\\x81 ed master or prototype deï¬\\x81 ned contribution plan maintained by \\nthe Employer, a welfare beneï¬\\x81 t fund maintained by the Employer, an \\n\\nindividual medical account maintained by the Employer, or a simpliï¬\\x81 ed \\nemployee pension plan maintained by the Employer any of which pro-\\nvides an Annual Addition as deï¬\\x81 ned in the Deï¬\\x81 nitions Section of the \\nPlan during any Limitation Year, the following rules apply.\\n\\n1.  The Annual Additions that may be credited to a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\n\\nIndividual Account under this Plan for any such Limitation Year will \\nnot exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount, reduced by the Annual \\nAdditions credited to a Participant under the other qualiï¬\\x81 ed Master or \\nPrototype Plans, welfare beneï¬\\x81 t funds, individual medical account, \\nand simpliï¬\\x81 ed employee pension plans for the same Limitation Year. \\nIf the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under other \\nqualiï¬\\x81 ed Master or Prototype deï¬\\x81 ned contribution plans, welfare \\nbeneï¬\\x81 t funds, individual medical accounts, and simpliï¬\\x81 ed employee \\npension plans maintained by the Employer are less than the \\nMaximum Permissible Amount, and the Employer Contribution that \\nwould otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nIndividual Account under this Plan would cause the Annual Additions \\nfor the Limitation Year to exceed this limitation, the amount contrib-\\nuted or allocated may be reduced so that the Annual Additions under \\nall such plans and funds for the Limitation Year will equal the \\nMaximum Permissible Amount. If the Annual Additions with respect to \\nthe Participant under such other qualiï¬\\x81 ed Master or Prototype deï¬\\x81 ned \\ncontribution plans, welfare beneï¬\\x81 t funds, individual medical accounts, \\nand simpliï¬\\x81 ed employee pension plans in the aggregate are equal to \\nor greater than the Maximum Permissible Amount, no amount will be \\ncontributed or allocated to the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account under \\nthis Plan for the Limitation Year.\\n\\n2.  Before determining the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s actual Compensation for the \\n\\nLimitation Year, the Employer may determine the Maximum \\nPermissible Amount for a Participant in the manner described in Plan \\nSection 3.05(A)(2).\\n\\n3.  As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the \\n\\nLimitation Year, the Maximum Permissible Amount for the Limitation \\nYear will be determined on the basis of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s actual \\nCompensation for the Limitation Year.\\n\\n4.  Any Excess Annual Additions attributed to this Plan will be disposed \\n\\nof in the manner described in Plan Section 3.05(A)(4).\\n\\nC.  If the Participant is covered under another qualiï¬\\x81 ed deï¬\\x81 ned contri-\\nbution plan maintained by the Employer, other than a Master or \\nPrototype Plan, the provisions of Plan Section 3.05(B)(1) through \\n3.05(B)(4) will apply as if the other plan were a Master or Prototype \\nPlan. In the event this method cannot be administered because of \\nconï¬\\x82 icting language in the other plan, the Employer must provide, \\nthrough a written attachment to the Plan, the method under which the \\nplans will limit total Annual Additions to the Maximum Permissible \\nAmount, and will properly reduce any Excess Annual Additions in a \\nmanner that precludes Employer discretion.\\n\\n3.06 Actual Deferral Percentage Test (ADP)\\n\\nA.  Limits on Highly Compensated Employeesâ\\x80\\x94The Actual Deferral \\nPercentage (hereinafter â\\x80\\x9cADPâ\\x80\\x9d) for a Plan Year for Participants who are \\nHighly Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the ADP for \\nParticipants who are non-Highly Compensated Employees for the same \\nPlan Year must satisfy one of the following tests.\\n\\n1.  The ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees \\nfor the Plan Year will not exceed the ADP for Participants who are \\nnon-Highly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year multi-\\nplied by 1.25; or\\n\\n2.  The ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for \\n\\nthe Plan Year will not exceed the ADP for Participants who are non-\\nHighly Compensated Employees for the same Plan Year multiplied by \\n2.0 provided that the ADP for Participants who are Highly \\nCompensated Employees does not exceed the ADP for Participants \\nwho are non-Highly Compensated Employees by more than two \\npercentage points.', 'The prior-year testing method described below will apply to this Plan. \\n\\n14 Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document\\n\\n\\x0c3.  Prior-Year Testingâ\\x80\\x94The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are \\n\\nHighly Compensated Employees for each Plan Year and the prior yearâ\\x80\\x99s \\nADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated Employees for \\nthe prior Plan Year must satisfy one of the following tests.\\n\\na.  The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly \\n\\nCompensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the prior \\nyearâ\\x80\\x99s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated \\nEmployees for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 1.25; or\\n\\nb.  The ADP for a Plan Year for Participants who are Highly \\n\\nCompensated Employees for the Plan Year will not exceed the prior \\nyearâ\\x80\\x99s ADP for Participants who were non-Highly Compensated \\nEmployees for the prior Plan Year multiplied by 2.0, provided that \\nthe ADP for Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees \\ndoes not exceed the ADP for Participants who were non-Highly \\nCompensated Employees in the prior Plan Year by more than two \\npercentage points.', 'For the ï¬\\x81 rst Plan Year that the Plan permits any Participant to make \\nElective Deferrals and if this is not a successor Plan, for purposes of \\nthe preceding tests, the prior yearâ\\x80\\x99s non-Highly Compensated \\nEmployeesâ\\x80\\x99 ADP will be three-percent. \\n\\nB.  Special Rules\\n\\n1.  A Participant is a Highly Compensated Employee for a particular Plan \\n\\nYear if they meet the deï¬\\x81 nition of a Highly Compensated Employee \\nin effect for that Plan Year. Similarly, a Participant is a non-Highly \\nCompensated Employee for a particular Plan Year if they do not meet \\nthe deï¬\\x81 nition of a Highly Compensated Employee in effect for that \\nPlan Year.\\n\\n2.  The ADP for any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee \\n\\nfor the Plan Year and who is eligible to have Elective Deferrals allo-\\ncated to their Individual Accounts under two or more arrangements \\ndescribed in Code section 401(k) that are maintained by the \\nEmployer, will be determined as if such Elective Deferrals were made \\nunder a single arrangement. If a Highly Compensated Employee \\nparticipates in two or more cash or deferred arrangements that have \\ndifferent Plan Years, all Elective Deferrals made during the Plan Year \\nunder all such arrangements will be aggregated. For Plan Years \\nbeginning before 2006, cash or deferred arrangements ending with \\nor within the same calendar year will be treated as a single arrange-\\nment. Notwithstanding the preceding, certain plans will be treated \\nas separate if mandatorily disaggregated under the Treasury \\nRegulations under Code section 401(k).\\n\\n3.  In the event that this Plan satisï¬\\x81 es the requirements of Code sec-\\n\\ntions 401(k), 401(a)(4), or 410(b) only if aggregated with one or more \\nother plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the requirements \\nof such Code sections only if aggregated with this Plan, then this \\nPlan Section 3.06(B)(3) will be applied by determining the ADP of \\nParticipants as if all such plans were a single plan. If more than \\nten-percent of the Employerâ\\x80\\x99s non-Highly Compensated Employees \\nare involved in a plan coverage change as deï¬\\x81 ned in Treasury \\nRegulation section 1.401(k)-2(c)(4), then any adjustments to the \\nnon-Highly Compensated Employee ADP for the prior year will be \\nmade in accordance with such regulations. Plans may be aggregated \\nin order to satisfy Code section 401(k) only if they have the same \\nPlan Year and use the same ADP testing method. \\n\\n4.  For purposes of satisfying the ADP test, Elective Deferrals must be \\nmade before the end of the 12-month period immediately following \\nthe Plan Year to which contributions relate.\\n\\n5.  The Employer shall maintain records sufï¬\\x81 cient to demonstrate satis-\\n\\nfaction of the ADP test.\\n\\n6.  The determination and treatment of the ADP amounts of any \\n\\nParticipant will satisfy such other requirements as may be pre-\\nscribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\\n\\n7.  In the event that the Plan Administrator determines that it is not \\nlikely that the ADP test will be satisï¬\\x81 ed for a particular Plan Year \\nunless certain steps are taken before the end of such Plan Year, the \\n\\nS\\ne\\nc\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n\\nPlan Administrator may require Contributing Participants who are \\nHighly Compensated Employees to reduce or cease future Elective \\nDeferrals for such Plan Year in order to satisfy that requirement. This \\nlimitation will be considered a Plan-imposed limit for Catch-up \\nContribution purposes. If the Plan Administrator requires Contributing \\nParticipants to reduce or cease making Elective Deferrals under this \\nparagraph, the reduction or cessation will begin with the Highly \\nCompensated Employee with either the largest amount of Elective \\nDeferrals or the highest Contribution Percentage for the Plan Year (on \\nthe date on which it is determined that the ADP test will not likely be \\nsatisï¬\\x81 ed), as elected by the Plan Administrator. All remaining Highly \\nCompensated Employeesâ\\x80\\x99 Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year will be \\nlimited to such amount. Notwithstanding the preceding, if it is later \\ndetermined that the ADP test for the Plan Year will be satisï¬\\x81 ed, \\nHighly Compensated Employees will be permitted to enroll again as \\nContributing Participants in accordance with the terms of the Plan.\\n\\n8.  Elective Deferrals that are treated as Catch-up Contributions \\n\\nbecause they exceed a Plan limit or a statutory limit will be excluded \\nfrom ADP testing. Amounts which are characterized as Catchâ\\x80\\x93up \\nContributions as a result of the ADP test will reduce the amount of \\nExcess Contributions distributed.\\n\\nSection Four: Vesting and Forfeitures\\nAn Employee is 100 percent vested in their Individual Account which \\nshall be nonforfeitable at all times.\\n\\nSection Five: Distributions and Loans to Participants\\n\\n5.01 Distributions\\n\\nA.  Eligibility for Distributions\\n\\n1.  Entitlement to Distributionâ\\x80\\x94A Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account shall \\n\\nbe distributable to the Participant upon the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Termination \\nof Employment, attainment of Normal Retirement Age, Disability, \\nattainment of age 59Â½, or the termination of the Plan. If a \\nParticipant who is entitled to a distribution is not legally competent \\nto request or consent to a distribution, the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s court-\\nappointed guardian, an attorney-in-fact acting under a valid power of \\nattorney, or any other individual or entity authorized under state law \\nto act on behalf of the Participant, may request and accept a distri-\\nbution of the Vested portion of a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account \\nunder this Plan Section 5.01(A).\\n\\n2.

Limits on Distribution Periodsâ\\x80\\x94As of the ï¬\\x81 rst Distribution Calendar \\n\\nYear, distributions to a Participant, if not made in a single sum, \\nmay only be made over one of the following periods (or a combina-\\ntion thereof): \\n\\na.  the life of the Participant,\\n\\nb.  the joint lives of the Participant and a Designated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary,\\n\\nc.  a period certain not extending beyond the Life Expectancy of the \\n\\nParticipant, or\\n\\nd.  a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor \\n\\nexpectancy of the Participant and a Designated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary. \\n\\nB.  Time and Manner of Distribution\\n\\n1.  Required Beginning Dateâ\\x80\\x94The Participantâ\\x80\\x99s entire interest will be \\ndistributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later \\nthan the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Required Beginning Date.', 'For purposes of this Plan Section 5.05(B) and Plan Section 5.05(D), \\nunless Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(iii) applies, distributions are consid-\\nered to begin on the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Required Beginning Date. If Plan \\nSection 5.05(D)(2)(a)(iii) applies, distributions are considered to \\nbegin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving \\nSpouse under Plan Section 5.05(D)(2)(a)(i). If distributions under an \\nannuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably com-\\nmence to the Participant before the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Required Beginning \\nDate (or to the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s surviving Spouse before the date distri-\\nbutions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse in Plan Section \\n5.05(D)(2)(a)(i)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the \\ndate distributions actually commence.\\n\\nExcept as provided in a separate IRS model amendment, if appli-\\ncable, Participants or Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries may elect on an individual basis \\nwhether the ï¬\\x81 ve-year rule or the life expectancy rule in Plan Section \\n5.05(D) applies to distributions after the death of a Participant who \\nhas a Designated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary.

Required Minimum Distributions During Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Lifetime\\n\\n1.  Amount of Required Minimum Distribution for Each Distribution \\nCalendar Yearâ\\x80\\x94During the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s lifetime, the minimum \\namount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year \\nis the lesser of:\\n\\na.  the quotient obtained by dividing the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Beneï¬\\x81 t by the \\n\\ndistribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in \\n\\nb.  if the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s sole Designated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary for the Distribution \\nCalendar Year is the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Spouse, the quotient obtained by \\ndividing the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Beneï¬\\x81 t by the number in the Joint and \\nLast Survivor Table set forth in Treasury Regulation section \\n1.401(a)(9)-9, Q&A 3, using the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s and Spouseâ\\x80\\x99s attained \\nages as of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s and Spouseâ\\x80\\x99s birthdays in the \\nDistribution Calendar Year. \\n\\n2.  Lifetime Required Minimum Distributions Continue Through Year of \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s Deathâ\\x80\\x94Required minimum distributions will be deter-\\nmined under this Plan Section 5.05(C) beginning with the ï¬\\x81 rst \\nDistribution Calendar Year and up to and including the Distribution \\nCalendar Year that includes the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s date of death.\\n\\nD.  Required Minimum Distributions After Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Death\\n\\n1.  Death On or After Date Distributions Begin\\n\\na.  Participant Survived by Designated Beneï¬\\x81 ciaryâ\\x80\\x94If the Participant \\n\\ndies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a \\nDesignated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary, the minimum amount that will be distrib-\\nuted for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s death is the quotient obtained by dividing the \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s beneï¬\\x81 t by the longer of the remaining Life Expectancy \\nof the Participant or the remaining Life Expectancy of the \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s Designated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary, determined as follows:\\n\\ni.  The Participantâ\\x80\\x99s remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using \\nthe age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one \\nfor each subsequent year.\\n\\nii.  If the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s surviving Spouse is the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s sole \\nDesignated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary, the remaining Life Expectancy of the \\nsurviving Spouse is calculated for each Distribution Calendar \\nYear after the year of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s death using the surviving \\nSpouseâ\\x80\\x99s age as of the Spouseâ\\x80\\x99s birthday in that year. For \\nDistribution Calendar Years after the year of the surviving \\nSpouseâ\\x80\\x99s death, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving \\nSpouse is calculated using the age of the surviving Spouse as \\nof the Spouseâ\\x80\\x99s birthday in the calendar year of the Spouseâ\\x80\\x99s \\ndeath, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year.\\n\\niii.  If the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s surviving Spouse is not the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s sole \\nDesignated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary, the Designated Beneï¬\\x81 ciaryâ\\x80\\x99s remaining \\nLife Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Designated \\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciary in the year following the year of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\ndeath, reduced by one for each subsequent year.\\n\\nb.  No Designated Beneï¬\\x81 ciaryâ\\x80\\x94If the Participant dies on or after the \\n\\ndate distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary as of \\nSeptember 30 of the year after the year of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s death, \\nthe minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution \\nCalendar Year after the year of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s death is the quotient \\nobtained by dividing the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s beneï¬\\x81 t by the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nremaining Life Expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant \\nin the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year.\\n\\n2.

If the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s surviving Spouse is not the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s sole \\nDesignated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary, then, (except as provided in a separate \\nIRS model amendment, if applicable), distributions to the \\nDesignated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary will begin by December 31 of the calen-\\ndar year immediately following the calendar year in which the \\nParticipant died. \\n\\niii.  If the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s surviving Spouse is the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s sole \\n\\nDesignated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary and the surviving Spouse dies after the \\nParticipant but before distributions to the surviving Spouse are \\nrequired to begin, this Plan Section 5.05(D)(2), other than Plan \\nSection 5.05(D)(2)(a), will apply as if the surviving Spouse were \\nthe Participant.\\n\\nb.

TEFRA Section 242(b) Elections\\n\\n1.  Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Plan Section 5.05 \\n\\nand subject to the requirements of Plan Section 5.10, Joint and \\nSurvivor Annuity Requirements, distribution on behalf of any \\nEmployee (or former Employee), including a ï¬\\x81 ve-percent owner, who \\nhas made a designation under the Tax Equity and Fiscal \\nResponsibility Act of 1982 Section 242(b)(2) (a â\\x80\\x9cSection 242(b)(2) \\nElectionâ\\x80\\x9d) may be made in accordance with all of the following \\nrequirements (regardless of when such distribution commences).\\n\\na.  The distribution by the Fund is one which would not have qualiï¬\\x81 ed \\nsuch Fund under Code section 401(a)(9) as in effect before amend-\\nment by the Deï¬\\x81 cit Reduction Act of 1984.\\n\\nb.  The distribution is in accordance with a method of distribution \\n\\ndesignated by the Employee whose interest in the Fund is being \\ndistributed or, if the Employee is deceased, by a Beneï¬\\x81 ciary of such \\nEmployee.\\n\\nc.  Such designation was in writing, was signed by the Employee or the \\n\\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciary, and was made before January 1, 1984.\\n\\nd.  The Employee had accrued a beneï¬\\x81 t under the Plan as of December \\n\\n31, 1983.\\n\\ne.  The method of distribution designated by the Employee or the \\n\\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciary speciï¬\\x81 es the time at which distribution will commence, \\nthe period over which distributions will be made, and in the case of \\nany distribution upon the Employeeâ\\x80\\x99s death, the Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries of the \\nEmployee listed in order of priority.\\n\\n2.  A distribution upon death will not be covered by this transitional rule \\n\\nunless the information in the designation contains the required \\ninformation described above with respect to the distributions to be \\nmade upon the death of the Employee.\\n\\n3.  If a designation is revoked, any subsequent distribution must satisfy \\n\\nthe requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding \\nregulations. If a designation is revoked subsequent to the date \\ndistributions are required to begin, the Plan must distribute, by the \\nend of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the \\nrevocation occurs, the total amount not yet distributed which would \\nhave been required to have been distributed to satisfy Code section \\n401(a)(9) and the corresponding regulations, but for an election \\nmade under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, \\nSection 242(b)(2). For calendar years beginning after December 31, \\n1988, such distributions must meet the minimum distribution inci-\\ndental beneï¬\\x81 t requirements. Any changes in the designation will be \\nconsidered to be a revocation of the designation. However, the mere \\nsubstitution or addition of another Beneï¬\\x81 ciary (one not named in the \\ndesignation) under the designation will not be considered to be a \\nrevocation of the designation, provided such substitution or addition \\ndoes not alter the period over which distributions are to be made \\nunder the designation, directly or indirectly (for example, by altering \\nthe relevant measuring life). \\n\\n4.  In the case in which an amount is transferred or rolled over from one \\n\\nplan to another plan, the rules in Treasury Regulation section \\n1.401(a)(9)-8, Q&A 14 and Q&A 15, will apply.\\n\\nF.  Transition Rulesâ\\x80\\x94For plans in existence before 2003, required \\nminimum distributions before 2003 were made pursuant to Plan \\nSection 5.05(E), if applicable, and Plan Sections 5.05(F)(1) through \\n5.05(F)(3) below.\\n\\n1.  2000 and Beforeâ\\x80\\x94Required minimum distributions for calendar \\n\\nyears after 1984 and before 2001 were made in accordance with \\nCode section 401(a)(9) and the corresponding Proposed Treasury \\nRegulations published in the Federal Register on July 27, 1987 (the \\nâ\\x80\\x9c1987 Proposed Regulationsâ\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n2.  2001â\\x80\\x94Required minimum distributions for calendar year 2001 were \\nmade in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the Proposed \\nTreasury Regulations in Section 401(a)(9) as published in the Federal \\nRegister on January 17, 2001 (the â\\x80\\x9c2001 Proposed Regulationsâ\\x80\\x9d) \\nunless a prior IRS model amendment provision was adopted that \\nstated that the required minimum distributions for 2001 were made \\npursuant to the 1987 Proposed Regulations. If distributions were \\nmade in 2001 under the 1987 Proposed Regulations before the date \\nin 2001 that the Plan began operating under the 2001 Proposed \\nRegulations, the special transition rule in Announcement 2001-82, \\n2001-2 C.B. 123, applied.\\n\\n3.  2002â\\x80\\x94Required minimum distributions for calendar year 2002 were \\n\\nmade in accordance with Code section 401(a)(9) and the 2001 \\nProposed Regulations unless the prior IRS model amendment, if \\napplicable, provided that either a. or b. below applies.\\n\\na.  Required minimum distributions for 2002 were made pursuant to \\n\\nthe 1987 Proposed Regulations.\\n\\nb.  Required minimum distributions for 2002 were made pursuant to \\nthe Final and Temporary Treasury Regulations under Code section \\n401(a)(9) published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2002 (the \\nâ\\x80\\x9c2002 Final and Temporary Regulationsâ\\x80\\x9d), which are described in \\nPlan Sections 5.05(B) through 5.05(E). If distributions were made \\nin 2002 under either the 1987 Proposed Regulations or the 2001 \\nProposed Regulations before the date in 2002 on which the Plan \\nbegan operating under the 2002 Final and Temporary Regulations, \\nthe special transition rule in Section 1.2 of the model amendment \\nin Revenue Procedure 2002-29, 2002-1 C.B. 1176, applied.\\n\\nG.  Temporary Waiver of Required Minimum Distribution Requirementsâ\\x80\\x94\\nNotwithstanding anything in the Plan or the deï¬\\x81 nition of Distribution \\nCalendar Year to the contrary, Participants and Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries who would \\nhave been required to receive a 2009 RMD or Extended 2009 RMD but \\nfor the enactment of Code section 401(a)(9)(H) were given the choice to \\nreceive such distributions for 2009. \\n\\nIf a Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary described above was allowed to remove \\ntheir 2009 RMD or Extended 2009 RMD but did not elect to receive such \\namount, the 2009 RMD or Extended 2009 RMD was retained in the Plan. \\n\\n20 Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document\\n\\n\\x0cS\\ne\\nc\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n\\nIn addition, notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if a \\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciaryâ\\x80\\x99s balance was required to be distributed under Code section \\n401(a)(9)(B)(ii), the ï¬\\x81 ve-year period described in such section will be \\ndetermined without regard to calendar year 2009.\\n\\n5.06 Annuity Contracts\\n\\nAny annuity contract distributed under the Plan (if permitted or required \\nby this Plan Section Five) must be nontransferable. The terms of any \\nannuity contract purchased and distributed by the Plan to a Participant \\nor Spouse will comply with the requirements of the Plan.\\n\\n5.07 Distributions In-Kind\\n\\nThe Plan Administrator may, but need not, cause any distribution under \\nthis Plan to be made either in a form actually held in the Fund, or in \\ncash by converting assets other than cash into cash, or in any combina-\\ntion of the two preceding methods. Assets other than cash, or other \\nassets with a readily ascertainable market value, must be subject to a \\nthird-party appraisal before they may be distributed from the Plan.\\n\\n5.08 Procedure for Missing Participants or Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries\\n\\nThe Plan Administrator must use all reasonable measures to locate \\nParticipants or Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries who are entitled to distributions from the \\nPlan. Such measures may include using certiï¬\\x81 ed mail, checking records \\nof other plans maintained by the Employer, contacting the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciaries, using a governmental letter-forwarding service, or using \\ninternet search tools, commercial locator services, and credit reporting \\nagencies. The Plan Administrator should consider the cost of the mea-\\nsures relative to the Individual Account balance when determining which \\nmeasures are used.\\n\\nIn the event that the Plan Administrator cannot locate a Participant or \\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciary who is entitled to a distribution from the Plan after using all \\nreasonable measures, the Plan Administrator may, consistent with \\napplicable laws, regulations, and other pronouncements under the Code \\nand ERISA, use any reasonable procedure to dispose of distributable \\nPlan assets, including any of the following: 1) establish an individual \\nretirement arrangement (IRA), under Code section 408, that complies \\nwith the automatic rollover safe harbor regulations, without regard to \\nthe amount in the Individual Account, 2) establish a federally insured \\nbank account for and in the name of the Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary and \\ntransfer the assets to such bank account, 3) purchase an annuity con-\\ntract with the assets in the name of the Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary \\n(unless an annuity form of distribution is prohibited under the Plan), or \\n4) transfer the assets to the unclaimed property fund of the state in \\nwhich the Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary was last known to reside. \\n\\nIn the event the Plan is terminated, payments must be made in a man-\\nner that protects the beneï¬\\x81 t rights of a Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary. \\nBeneï¬\\x81 t rights will be deemed to be protected if the amount in a \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s or Beneï¬\\x81 ciaryâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account is placed into an IRA, \\nused to purchase an annuity contract, or transferred to another quali-\\nï¬\\x81 ed retirement plan. Beneï¬\\x81 t rights need not, however, be protected if an \\nIndividual Account becomes subject to state escheat laws, or if a pay-\\nment is made to satisfy Code section 401(a)(9), or if such other pro-\\ncess is followed that is consistent with applicable statutory or \\nregulatory guidance.\\n\\n5.09 Claims Procedures\\n\\nA.  Filing a Claim for Plan Distributionsâ\\x80\\x94A Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary who \\nhas been denied a request for a distribution or loan and desires to \\nmake a claim for the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account will ï¬\\x81 le a request \\n(either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules promulgated \\nby the IRS and DOL and acceptable to the Plan Administrator) with the \\nPlan Administrator. If such request is required in writing, such request \\nmust be made on a form furnished to them by the Plan Administrator \\nfor such purpose. The request will set forth the basis of the claim. The \\nPlan Administrator is authorized to conduct such examinations as may \\nbe necessary to facilitate the payment of any beneï¬\\x81 ts to which the \\nParticipant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary may be entitled under the terms of the Plan. \\n\\nB.  Denial of a Claimâ\\x80\\x94Whenever a claim for a Plan distribution or loan \\nsubmitted in accordance with this Plan Section 5.09 by any Participant \\nor Beneï¬\\x81 ciary has been wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator \\nmust furnish such Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary notice (either in writing or in \\nany other form permitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) \\nof the denial within 90 days (45 days for claims involving disability \\nbeneï¬\\x81 ts) of the date the original claim was ï¬\\x81 led. This notice will set \\nforth the speciï¬\\x81 c reasons for the denial, speciï¬\\x81 c reference to pertinent \\nPlan provisions on which the denial is based, a description of any addi-\\ntional information or material needed to perfect the claim, an explana-\\ntion of why such additional information or material is necessary, and an \\nexplanation of the procedures for appeal. \\n\\nC.  Remedies Availableâ\\x80\\x94The Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary will have 60 days \\nfrom receipt of the denial notice in which to make written application for \\nreview by the Plan Administrator. The Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary may \\nrequest that the review be in the nature of a hearing. The Participant or \\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciary will have the right to representation, to review pertinent \\ndocuments, and to submit comments in writing (or in any other form \\npermitted by the IRS or DOL). The Plan Administrator shall issue a \\ndecision on such review within 60 days (45 days for claims involving \\ndisability beneï¬\\x81 ts) after receipt of an application for review as provided \\nfor in this Plan Section 5.09. Upon a decision unfavorable to the \\nParticipant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary, such Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary will be entitled \\nto bring such actions in law or equity as may be necessary or appropri-\\nate to protect or clarify their right to beneï¬\\x81 ts under this Plan.\\n\\n5.10 Joint and Survivor Annuity Requirements\\n\\nA.  Applicationâ\\x80\\x94The provisions of this Plan Section 5.10 will apply to \\nany Participant who is credited with at least one Hour of Service with \\nthe Employer on or after August 23, 1984, and such other Participants \\nas provided in Treasury Regulations.\\n\\nB.  Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuityâ\\x80\\x94Unless an optional form of \\nbeneï¬\\x81 t is selected pursuant to a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Election within the 180-day \\nperiod ending on the Annuity Starting Date, a married Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nIndividual Account Balance will be paid in the form of a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint \\nand Survivor Annuity and an unmarried Participantâ\\x80\\x99s account balance \\nwill be paid in the form of a life annuity. The Participant may elect to \\nhave such annuity distributed upon attainment of the Earliest \\nRetirement Age under the Plan. In the case of a married Participant, the \\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity must be at least as valuable as any \\nother optional form of beneï¬\\x81 t payable under the Plan at the same time.\\n\\nA Plan that is subject to the Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity require-\\nments must offer an additional survivor annuity option in the form of a \\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Optional Survivor Annuity. \\n\\nC.  Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Preretirement Survivor Annuityâ\\x80\\x94Unless an optional form of \\nbeneï¬\\x81 t has been selected within the Election Period pursuant to a \\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Election, if a Participant dies before the Annuity Starting Date \\nthen the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account shall be applied toward the \\npurchase of an annuity for the life of the surviving Spouse. The surviv-\\ning Spouse may elect to have such annuity distributed within a reason-\\nable period after the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s death.\\n\\nD.  Notice Requirements\\n\\n1.  In the case of a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity, the Plan \\n\\nAdministrator shall no less than 30 days and not more than 180 \\ndays before the Annuity Starting Date provide each Participant an \\nexplanation (either in writing or in any other form permitted under \\nrules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) of 1) the terms and condi-\\ntions of a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity, 2) the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nright to make and the effect of an election to waive the Qualiï¬\\x81 ed \\nJoint and Survivor Annuity form of beneï¬\\x81 t, 3) the rights of a \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s Spouse, and 4) the right to make, and the effect of, a \\nrevocation of a previous election to waive the Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and \\nSurvivor Annuity. The written explanation shall comply with the \\nrequirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.417(a)(3)-1.', 'The Annuity Starting Date for a distribution in a form other than a \\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity may be less than 30 days after \\nreceipt of the explanation described in the preceding paragraph \\n\\nIndividual 401(k) Basic Plan Document  21\\n\\n\\x0cprovided 1) the Participant has been provided with information that \\nclearly indicates that the Participant has at least 30 days to con-\\nsider whether to waive the Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity and \\nelect (with spousal consent) a form of distribution other than a \\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity, 2) the Participant is permitted to \\nrevoke any afï¬\\x81 rmative distribution election at least until the annuity \\nstarting date or, if later, at any time before the expiration of the \\nseven-day period that begins the day after the explanation of the \\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity is provided to the Participant, \\nand 3) the annuity starting date is a date after the date that the \\nexplanation was provided to the Participant.\\n\\n2.  In the case of a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity as described \\n\\nin Plan Section 5.10(C), the Plan Administrator shall provide each \\nParticipant within the applicable period for such Participant an expla-\\nnation (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules \\npromulgated by the IRS and DOL) of the Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Preretirement \\nSurvivor Annuity in such terms and in such manner as would be \\ncomparable to the explanation provided for meeting the requirements \\nof Plan Section 5.10(D)(1) applicable to a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor \\nAnnuity. The written explanation shall comply with the requirements \\nof Treasury Regulation section 1.417(a)(3)-1.', 'The applicable period for a Participant is whichever of the following \\nperiods ends last: 1) the period beginning with the ï¬\\x81 rst day of the \\nPlan Year in which the Participant attains age 32 and ending with \\nthe close of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the \\nParticipant attains age 35, 2) a reasonable period ending after the \\nindividual becomes a Participant, 3) a reasonable period ending after \\nPlan Section 5.10(D)(3) ceases to apply to the Participant, and 4) a \\nreasonable period ending after this Plan Section 5.10 ï¬\\x81 rst applies to \\nthe Participant. Notwithstanding the preceding, notice must be \\nprovided within a reasonable period ending after separation from \\nservice in the case of a Participant who separates from service \\nbefore attaining age 35.\\n\\nFor purposes of applying the preceding paragraph, a reasonable \\nperiod ending after the enumerated events described in 2), 3) and 4) \\nis the end of the two-year period beginning one year before the date \\nthe applicable event occurs, and ending one year after that date. In \\nthe case of a Participant who separates from service before the Plan \\nYear in which age 35 is attained, notice will be provided within the \\ntwo-year period beginning one year before separation and ending one \\nyear after separation. If such a Participant thereafter returns to \\nemployment with the Employer, the applicable period for such \\nParticipant will be redetermined.\\n\\n3.  Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Plan Section 5.10(D), \\nthe respective notices prescribed by this Plan Section 5.10(D) need \\nnot be given to a Participant if 1) the Plan â\\x80\\x9cfully subsidizesâ\\x80\\x9d the \\ncosts of a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualiï¬\\x81 ed \\nPreretirement Survivor Annuity, and 2) the Plan does not allow the \\nParticipant to waive the Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or \\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity and does not allow a married \\nParticipant to designate a non-Spouse Beneï¬\\x81 ciary. For purposes of \\nthis Plan Section 5.10(D)(3), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a \\nbeneï¬\\x81 t if no increase in cost or decrease in beneï¬\\x81 ts to the Participant \\nmay result from the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s failure to elect another beneï¬\\x81 t.\\n\\nE.  Retirement Equity Act Safe Harbor Rules\\n\\n1.  The safe harbor provisions of this Plan Section 5.10(E) shall always \\n\\napply to any distribution made on or after the ï¬\\x81 rst day of the ï¬\\x81 rst \\nPlan Year beginning after December 31, 1988, from or under a \\nseparate account attributable solely to accumulated deductible \\nemployee contributions, as deï¬\\x81 ned in Code section 72(o)(5)(B), and \\nmaintained on behalf of a Participant in a money purchase pension \\nplan, if the following conditions are satisï¬\\x81 ed:\\n\\na.  the Participant does not or cannot elect payments in the form of a \\n\\nlife annuity; and\\n\\nb.  on the death of a Participant, the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s account balance will \\n\\nmanner conforming to a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Election, then to the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nDesignated Beneï¬\\x81 ciary. The surviving Spouse may elect to have \\ndistribution of the account balance commence within the 180-day \\nperiod following the date of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s death. The account \\nbalance shall be adjusted for gains or losses occurring after the \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s death in accordance with the provisions of the Plan \\ngoverning the adjustment of account balances for other types of \\ndistributions. This Plan Section 5.10(E) will not apply to a \\nParticipant in a proï¬\\x81 t sharing plan if the plan is a direct or indirect \\ntransferee of a deï¬\\x81 ned beneï¬\\x81 t plan, money purchase pension plan, \\na target beneï¬\\x81 t pension plan, stock bonus, or proï¬\\x81 t sharing plan \\nthat is subject to the survivor annuity requirements of Code sec-\\ntions 401(a)(11) and 417. If this Plan Section 5.10(E) applies, then \\nno other provisions of this Plan Section 5.10 will apply except as \\nprovided in Treasury Regulations.\\n\\n2.  The Participant may waive the spousal death beneï¬\\x81 t described in \\nthis Plan Section 5.10(E) at any time provided that no such waiver \\nwill be effective unless it is a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Election (other than the \\nnotiï¬\\x81 cation requirement referred to therein) that would apply to the \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s waiver of the Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Preretirement Survivor Annuity.\\n\\n3.  In the event this Plan is a direct or indirect transferee of or a \\n\\nrestatement of a plan previously subject to the survivor annuity \\nrequirements of Code sections 401(a)(11) and 417 and the Employer \\nhas selected to have this Plan Section 5.10(E) apply, the provisions \\nof this Plan Section 5.10(E) will not apply to any beneï¬\\x81 ts accrued \\n(including subsequent adjustments for earnings and losses) before \\nthe adoption of these provisions. Such amounts will be separately \\naccounted for in a manner consistent with Plan Section 7.02 and \\nadministered in accordance with the general survivor annuity require-\\nments of Plan Section 5.10. \\n\\n5.11 Liability for Withholding on Distributions\\n\\nThe Plan Administrator shall be responsible for withholding federal \\nincome taxes from distributions from the Plan, unless the Participant (or \\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciary, where applicable) elects not to have such taxes withheld. The \\nTrustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or other payor may act as agent for \\nthe Plan Administrator to withhold such taxes and to make the appropri-\\nate distribution reports, provided the Plan Administrator furnishes all the \\ninformation to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) or other payor \\nwhich such payor may need to properly perform withholding and reporting. \\n\\n5.12 Distribution of Excess Elective Deferrals\\n\\nA.  General Ruleâ\\x80\\x94A Participant may assign to this Plan any Excess \\nElective Deferrals made during a taxable year of the Participant by \\nnotifying the Plan Administrator of the amount of the Excess Elective \\nDeferrals to be assigned to the Plan. Participants who claim Excess \\nElective Deferrals for the preceding calendar year must submit their \\nclaims (either in writing or in any other form permitted under rules \\npromulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Plan Administrator by March 1. \\nA Participant is deemed to notify the Plan Administrator of any Excess \\nElective Deferrals that arise by taking into account only those Elective \\nDeferrals made to this Plan and any other plan, contract, or arrange-\\nment of the Employer.\\n\\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, Excess Elective \\nDeferrals, plus any income and minus any loss allocable thereto, will be \\ndistributed no later than April 15th to any Participant to whose \\nIndividual Account Excess Elective Deferrals were assigned for the \\npreceding year and who claims Excess Elective Deferrals for such tax-\\nable year, except to the extent such Excess Elective Deferrals were \\nclassiï¬\\x81 ed as Catch-up Contributions. For years beginning after 2005, \\nthe Plan Administrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, will \\ndetermine whether the distribution of Excess Elective Deferrals for a \\nyear will be made ï¬\\x81 rst from the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Pre-Tax Elective Deferral \\naccount or the Roth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, \\nto the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals \\nwere made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify otherwise.\\n\\nbe paid to the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s surviving Spouse, but if there is no \\nsurviving Spouse, or if the surviving Spouse has consented in a \\n\\nB.  Determination of Income or Lossâ\\x80\\x94For taxable years beginning after \\n2007, Excess Elective Deferrals will be adjusted for any income or loss \\n\\n22 Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document\\n\\n\\x0cup to the end of the Plan Year to which such contributions were allo-\\ncated. The income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals is the \\nincome or loss allocable to the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Elective Deferral account \\nfor the taxable year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is \\nsuch Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Excess Elective Deferrals for the year and the denom-\\ninator of which is the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account balance attribut-\\nable to Elective Deferrals without regard to any income or loss occurring \\nduring such taxable year. For taxable years beginning before 2008, \\nincome or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals also included ten \\npercent of the amount determined under the preceding sentence multi-\\nplied by the number of whole calendar months between the end of the \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s taxable year and the date of distribution, counting the \\nmonth of distribution if distribution occurs after the 15th of such \\nmonth. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Plan Administrator \\nmay compute the income or loss allocable to Excess Elective Deferrals \\nin the manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B) (i.e., the usual manner \\nused by the Plan for allocating income or loss to Participantsâ\\x80\\x99 Individual \\nAccounts or any reasonable method), provided such method is used \\nconsistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under \\nthe Plan for the Plan Year. The Plan will not fail to use a reasonable \\nmethod for computing the income or loss on Excess Elective Deferrals \\nmerely because the income allocable is based on a date that is no \\nmore than seven days before the distribution.\\n\\n5.13 Distribution of Excess Contributions\\n\\nA.  General Ruleâ\\x80\\x94Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, \\nExcess Contributions, plus any income and minus any loss allocable \\nthereto, will be distributed no later than 12 months after a Plan Year to \\nParticipants to whose Individual Accounts such Excess Contributions \\nwere allocated for such Plan Year, except to the extent such Excess \\nContributions were classiï¬\\x81 ed as Catch-up Contributions. Excess \\nContributions are allocated to the Highly Compensated Employees with \\nthe largest amounts of Employer Contributions taken into account in \\ncalculating the ADP test for the year in which the excess arose, begin-\\nning with the Highly Compensated Employee with the largest amount of \\nsuch Employer Contributions and continuing in descending order until all \\nthe Excess Contributions have been allocated. Both the total amount of \\nthe Excess Contribution and, for purposes of the preceding sentence, \\nthe â\\x80\\x9clargest amountâ\\x80\\x9d are determined after distribution of any Excess \\nDeferrals. To the extent a Highly Compensated Employee has not \\nreached their Catch-up Contribution limit under the Plan, Excess \\nContributions allocated to such Highly Compensated Employees as \\nCatch-up Contributions will not be treated as Excess Contributions. If \\nsuch Excess Contributions are distributed more than 2Â½ months after \\nthe last day of the Plan Year in which such Contributions were made, a \\nten-percent excise tax will be imposed on the Employer maintaining the \\nPlan with respect to such amounts. Excess Contributions will be treated \\nas annual additions under the Plan even if distributed.\\n\\nB.  Determination of Income or Lossâ\\x80\\x94For taxable years beginning after \\n2007, Excess Contributions will be adjusted for any income or loss up \\nto the end of the Plan Year to which such contributions were allocated. \\nThe income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions allocated to each \\nParticipant is the income or loss allocable to the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Elective \\nDeferral account(s) for the Plan Year multiplied by a fraction, the numer-\\nator of which is such Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Excess Contributions for the year and \\nthe denominator of which is the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account balance \\nattributable to Elective Deferrals without regard to any income or loss \\noccurring during such Plan Year. For taxable years beginning before \\n2008, income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions also included \\nten percent of the amount determined under the preceding sentence \\nmultiplied by the number of whole calendar months between the end of \\nthe Participantâ\\x80\\x99s taxable year and the date of distribution, counting the \\nmonth of distribution if distribution occurs after the 15th of such \\nmonth. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Plan Administrator \\nmay compute the income or loss allocable to Excess Contributions in \\nthe manner described in Plan Section 7.02(B) (i.e., the usual manner \\nused by the Plan for allocating income or loss to Participantsâ\\x80\\x99 Individual \\nAccounts or any reasonable method), provided such method is used \\nconsistently for all Participants and for all corrective distributions under \\nthe Plan for the Plan Year. The Plan will not fail to use a reasonable \\nmethod for computing the income or loss on Excess Contributions \\n\\nmerely because the income allocable is based on a date that is no \\nmore than seven days before the distribution.\\n\\nC.  Accounting for Excess Contributionsâ\\x80\\x94Excess Contributions allocated \\nto a Participant will be distributed from the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Elective \\nDeferral account(s) in proportion to the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Elective Deferrals \\nfor the Plan Year. For years beginning after 2005, the Plan \\nAdministrator, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, will either \\ndetermine whether the distribution of Excess Contributions for a year \\nwill be made ï¬\\x81 rst from the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Pre-Tax Elective Deferral \\naccount or the Roth Elective Deferral account, or a combination of both, \\nto the extent both Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth Elective Deferrals \\nwere made for the year, or may allow Participants to specify otherwise. \\n\\nS\\ne\\nc\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n\\n5.14 Loans to Participants\\n\\nIf the Adoption Agreement so indicates, a Participant may receive a loan \\nfrom the Fund, subject to the following rules and the Planâ\\x80\\x99s loan policy.\\n\\nA.  Loans will be made available to all Participants on a reasonably \\nequivalent basis. Notwithstanding the preceding, new loans will not be \\navailable to Participants who cease to be employed by the Employer, \\nunless such Participants are parties-in-interest as deï¬\\x81 ned in ERISA \\nsection 3(14). In addition, existing loans will be considered due and \\npayable at such time as a Participant ceases to be an Employee, and \\nthe loan will be considered in default and the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual \\nAccount will be reduced by the outstanding amount of the loan unless \\notherwise speciï¬\\x81 ed in the loan policy statement or other loan documen-\\ntation.\\n\\nB.  Loans will not be made available to Highly Compensated Employees \\nin an amount greater than the amount made available to other \\nEmployees.\\n\\nC.  Loans must be adequately secured and bear a reasonable \\ninterest rate.\\n\\nD.  No Participant loan will exceed the Present Value of the Vested \\nportion of a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account. \\n\\nE.  A Participant must obtain the consent of their Spouse, if any, to the \\nuse of the Individual Account as security for the loan. Spousal consent \\nwill be obtained no earlier than the beginning of the 90-day period that \\nends on the date on which the loan is to be so secured. The consent \\nmust be in writing (or any other form permitted by the IRS and DOL), \\nmust acknowledge the effect of the loan, and must be witnessed by a \\nnotary public or plan representative. Such consent will thereafter be \\nbinding with respect to the consenting Spouse or any subsequent \\nSpouse with respect to that loan. A new consent will be required if the \\nIndividual Account is used for renegotiation, extension, renewal, or other \\nrevision of the loan. Notwithstanding the preceding, no spousal consent \\nis necessary if, at the time the loan is secured, no consent would be \\nrequired for a distribution under Code section 417(a)(2)(B). In addition, \\nspousal consent is not required if the Plan or the Participant is not \\nsubject to Code section 401(a)(11) at the time the Individual Account is \\nused as security, or if the total Individual Account subject to the secu-\\nrity is less than or equal to $5,000.\\n\\nF.  In the event of default, foreclosure on the note and attachment of \\nsecurity will not occur until a distribution eligibility requirement is met \\nunder the Plan.\\n\\nG.  For plan loans made before January 1, 2002, no loans will be made \\nto any shareholder-employee or Owner-Employee. For purposes of this \\nrequirement, a shareholder-employee means an employee or ofï¬\\x81 cer of \\nan electing small business (Subchapter S) corporation who owns (or is \\nconsidered as owning within the meaning of Code section 318(a)(1)), on \\nany day during the taxable year of such corporation, more than ï¬\\x81 ve-\\npercent of the outstanding stock of the corporation.\\n\\nH.  Loan repayments will be suspended under the Plan as permitted \\nunder Code section 414(u)(4) (USERRA).\\n\\nI.  For years beginning after 2005, if the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual \\nAccount contains any combination of Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth \\nElective Deferrals, the speciï¬\\x81 c rules governing the loan program may \\n\\nIndividual 401(k) Basic Plan Document  23\\n\\n\\x0calso designate the extent to which Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals and Roth \\nElective Deferrals, or any combination thereof will 1) be used to calcu-\\nlate the maximum amount available for a loan, or 2) be available as a \\nsource from which loan proceeds may be taken or which may be used \\nas security for a loan. To the extent permitted by law and related regula-\\ntions, the rules established by the Plan Sponsor may specify the order-\\ning rules to be applied in the event of a defaulted loan.\\n\\nIf a valid spousal consent has been obtained in accordance with Plan \\nSection 5.14(E), then, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, \\nthe portion of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account used as a security \\ninterest held by the Plan by reason of a loan outstanding to the \\nParticipant will be taken into account for purposes of determining the \\namount of the Individual Account payable at the time of death or distri-\\nbution, but only if the reduction is used as repayment of the loan. If \\nless than 100 percent of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account (deter-\\nmined without regard to the preceding sentence) is payable to the \\nsurviving Spouse, then the Individual Account will be adjusted by ï¬\\x81 rst \\nreducing the Individual Account by the amount of the security used as \\nrepayment of the loan, and then determining the beneï¬\\x81 t payable to the \\nsurviving Spouse.\\n\\nTo avoid taxation to the Participant, unless otherwise permitted by law \\nor regulatory guidance, no loan to any Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary can be \\nmade to the extent that such loan, when added to the outstanding \\nbalance of all other loans to the Participant, would exceed the lesser of \\n1) $50,000 reduced by the excess (if any) of the highest outstanding \\nbalance of loans during the one year period ending on the day before \\nthe loan is made, over the outstanding balance of loans from the Plan \\non the date the loan is made, or 2) 50 percent of the Present Value of \\nthe nonforfeitable Individual Account of the Participant. For the purpose \\nof the above limitation, all loans from all plans of the Employer and \\nother members of a group of employers described in Code sections \\n414(b), 414(c), and 414(m) are aggregated. Furthermore, any loan will \\nby its terms require that repayment (principal and interest) be amortized \\nin level payments, not less frequently than quarterly, over a period not \\nextending beyond ï¬\\x81 ve years from the date of the loan, unless such loan \\nis used to acquire a dwelling unit which, within a reasonable time (deter-\\nmined at the time the loan is made), will be used as the principal resi-\\ndence of the Participant. Notwithstanding the preceding, a Participant \\nwill suspend their loan repayments under this Plan as permitted under \\nCode section 414(u)(4). An assignment or pledge of any portion of the \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s interest in the Plan and a loan, pledge, or assignment with \\nrespect to any insurance contract purchased under the Plan, will be \\ntreated as a loan under this paragraph.\\n\\nThe Plan Administrator shall administer the loan program in accordance \\nwith speciï¬\\x81 c rules that are documented either in writing or in such other \\nformat as permitted by the IRS and the DOL. Such rules will include, at \\na minimum, the following: 1) the identity of the person or positions \\nauthorized to administer the Participant loan program, 2) the procedure \\nfor applying for loans, 3) the basis on which loans will be approved or \\ndenied, 4) limitations (if any) on the types and amounts of loans \\noffered, 5) the procedure under the program for determining a reason-\\nable rate of interest, 6) the types of collateral that may secure a \\nParticipant loan, and 7) the events constituting default and the steps \\nthat will be taken to preserve Plan assets in the event of such default.\\n\\nSection Six: Deï¬\\x81 nitions\\nWords and phrases used in the Plan with initial capital letters will, for \\nthe purpose of this Plan, have the meanings set forth in the portion of \\nthe Plan entitled â\\x80\\x9cDeï¬\\x81 nitionsâ\\x80\\x9d unless the context indicates that other \\nmeanings are intended. \\n\\nSection Seven: Miscellaneous\\n\\n7.01 The Fund\\n\\nA.  Establishment and Maintenanceâ\\x80\\x94By adopting this Plan, the \\nEmployer establishes the Fund, which will consist of the assets of the \\nPlan held by the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) pursuant to \\nSection Eight. Assets within the Fund may be pooled on behalf of all \\n\\n24 Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document\\n\\nParticipants, earmarked on behalf of each Participant, or be a combina-\\ntion of pooled and earmarked assets. To the extent that assets are \\nearmarked for a particular Participant, they will be held in a Separate \\nFund for that Participant. \\n\\nNo part of the corpus or income of the Fund may be used for, or \\ndiverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive beneï¬\\x81 t of Participants \\nor their Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries. The Fund will be valued each Valuation Date at \\nfair market value. \\n\\nB.  Division of Fund Into Investment Fundsâ\\x80\\x94The Employer may direct the \\nTrustee (or Custodian, if applicable) to divide and redivide the Fund into \\none or more Investment Funds. Such Investment Funds may include, but \\nare not limited to, Investment Funds representing the assets under the \\ncontrol of an investment manager pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(C) and \\nInvestment Funds representing investment options available for individual \\ndirection by Participants pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(B). Upon each \\ndivision or redivision, the Employer may specify the part of the Fund to be \\nallocated to each such Investment Fund and the terms and conditions, if \\nany, under which the assets in such Investment Fund will be invested.\\n\\n7.02 Individual Accounts\\n\\nA.  Establishment and Maintenanceâ\\x80\\x94The Plan Administrator shall estab-\\nlish and maintain an Individual Account in the name of each Participant \\nto reï¬\\x82 ect the total value of their interest in the Fund (including but not \\nlimited to Employer Contributions and earnings thereon). Each Individual \\nAccount established hereunder will consist of such subaccounts as may \\nbe needed for each Participant, including: \\n\\n1.  a subaccount to reï¬\\x82 ect Employer Contributions allocated on behalf of \\n\\na Participant; \\n\\n2.  a subaccount to reï¬\\x82 ect a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s rollover contributions; \\n\\n3.  a subaccount to reï¬\\x82 ect a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s transfer contributions; \\n\\n4.  a subaccount to reï¬\\x82 ect a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Pre-Tax Elective Deferrals; and\\n\\n5.  a subaccount to reï¬\\x82 ect a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Roth Elective Deferrals.\\n\\nThe Plan Administrator may establish additional accounts as it may \\ndeem necessary for the proper administration of the Plan. \\n\\nIf this Plan is funded by individual contracts that provide a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nBeneï¬\\x81 t under the Plan, such individual contracts will constitute the \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account. If this Plan is funded by group contracts \\nunder the group annuity or group insurance contract, premiums or other \\nconsideration received by the insurance company must be allocated to \\nParticipantsâ\\x80\\x99 Individual Accounts under the Plan.\\n\\nB.  Valuation of Individual Accounts\\n\\n1.  Where all or a portion of the assets of a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual \\n\\nAccount are invested in a Separate Fund for the Participant, then the \\nvalue of that portion of such Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account at any \\nrelevant time equals the sum of the fair market values of the assets \\nin such Separate Fund, less any applicable charges or penalties.\\n\\n2.  The fair market value of the remainder of each Individual Account is \\n\\ndetermined in the following manner:\\n\\na.  Separate Fundâ\\x80\\x94First, the portion of the Individual Account \\n\\ninvested in each Investment Fund as of the previous Valuation Date \\nis determined. Each such portion is reduced by any withdrawal \\nmade from the applicable Investment Fund to or for the beneï¬\\x81 t of a \\nParticipant or the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Beneï¬\\x81 ciary, further reduced by any \\ntransfer to another Investment Fund since the previous Valuation \\nDate, and is increased by any amount transferred from another \\nInvestment Fund since the previous Valuation Date. The resulting \\namounts are the net Individual Account portions invested in the \\nInvestment Funds.\\n\\nb.  No Separate Fundâ\\x80\\x94Second, the net Individual Account portions \\ninvested in each Investment Fund are adjusted upwards or down-\\nwards, pro rata (i.e., using the ratio of each net Individual Account \\nportion to the sum of all net Individual Account portions) so that the \\nsum of all the net Individual Account portions invested in an', 'S\\ne\\nc\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n\\nInvestment Fund will equal the then fair market value of the \\nInvestment Fund. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, for the \\nï¬\\x81 rst Plan Year only, the net Individual Account portions will be the \\nsum of all contributions made to each Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual \\nAccount during the ï¬\\x81 rst Plan Year.\\n\\nc.  Allocationsâ\\x80\\x94Third, any contributions to the Plan are allocated in \\n\\naccordance with the appropriate allocation provisions of Plan Section \\nThree. For purposes of this Plan Section Seven, contributions made \\nby the Employer for any Plan Year but after that Plan Year will be \\nconsidered to have been made on the last day of that Plan Year \\nregardless of when paid to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable).', 'Amounts contributed between Valuation Dates will not be credited with \\ninvestment gains or losses until the next following Valuation Date.\\n\\nd.  Aggregation of Portionsâ\\x80\\x94Finally, the portions of the Individual \\nAccount invested in each Investment Fund (determined in accor-\\ndance with (a), (b), and (c) above) are added together.\\n\\nC.  Modiï¬\\x81 cation of Method for Valuing Individual Accountsâ\\x80\\x94If neces-\\n\\nsary or appropriate, the Plan Administrator may establish different \\nor additional procedures (which will be uniform and nondiscrimina-\\ntory) for determining the fair market value of the Individual Accounts \\nincluding, but not limited to, valuation on a daily basis pursuant to \\nthe number of shares of each permissible investment held on \\nbehalf of a Participant. \\n\\n7.03 Powers and Duties of the Plan Administrator\\n\\nA.  The Plan Administrator will have the authority to control and manage \\nthe operation and administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator \\nshall administer the Plan for the exclusive beneï¬\\x81 t of the Participants and \\ntheir Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries in accordance with the speciï¬\\x81 c terms of the Plan.\\n\\nB.  The Plan Administrator may, by appointment, allocate the duties of \\nthe Plan Administrator among several individuals or entities. Such \\nappointments will not be effective until the party designated accepts \\nsuch appointment in writing.\\n\\nC.  The Plan Administrator shall be charged with the duties of the general \\nadministration of the Plan, including, but not limited to, the following:\\n\\n1.  to determine all questions of interpretation or policy in a manner \\n\\nconsistent with the Planâ\\x80\\x99s documents. The Plan Administratorâ\\x80\\x99s \\nconstruction or determination in good faith will be conclusive and \\nbinding on all persons except as otherwise provided herein or by law. \\nAny interpretation or construction will be done in a nondiscriminatory \\nmanner and will be consistent with the intent that the Plan will con-\\ntinue to be deemed a qualiï¬\\x81 ed plan under the terms of Code section \\n401(a), as amended from time to time, and will comply with the \\nterms of ERISA, as amended from time to time;\\n\\n2.  to determine all questions relating to the eligibility of Employees to \\n\\nbecome or remain Participants hereunder;\\n\\n3.  to compute the amounts necessary or desirable to be contributed to \\n\\nthe Plan;\\n\\n4.  to compute the amount and kind of beneï¬\\x81 ts to which a Participant or \\n\\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciary will be entitled under the Plan and to direct the Trustee \\n(or Custodian, if applicable) with respect to all disbursements under \\nthe Plan, and, when requested by the Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-\\ncable), to furnish the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) with \\ninstructions, in writing, on matters pertaining to the Plan on which \\nthe Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) may rely and act;\\n\\n5.  to maintain all records necessary for the administration of the Plan;\\n\\n6.  to prepare and ï¬\\x81 le such disclosures and tax forms as may be \\n\\nrequired from time to time by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary \\nof the Treasury; \\n\\n7.  to furnish each Employee, Participant, or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary such notices, \\n\\ninformation, and reports under such circumstances as may be \\nrequired by law;\\n\\n8.  to periodically review the performance of each Fiduciary and all other \\n\\nrelevant parties to ensure such individualsâ\\x80\\x99 obligations under the \\nPlan are performed in a manner that is acceptable under the Plan \\nand applicable law; and \\n\\n9.  to furnish a statement to each Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary no later \\n\\nthan 270 days after the close of each Plan Year, indicating the \\nIndividual Account balances of such Participant as of the last \\nValuation Date in such Plan Year.\\n\\nD.  The Plan Administrator will have all of the powers necessary or \\nappropriate to accomplish their duties under the Plan, including, but not \\nlimited to, the following:\\n\\n1.  to appoint and retain such persons as may be necessary to carry \\n\\nout the functions of the Plan Administrator;\\n\\n2.  to appoint and retain counsel, specialists, or other persons as the \\nPlan Administrator deems necessary or advisable in the administra-\\ntion of the Plan;\\n\\n3.  to resolve all questions of administration of the Plan;\\n\\n4.  to establish such uniform and nondiscriminatory rules that it deems \\n\\nnecessary to carry out the terms of the Plan;\\n\\n5.  to make any adjustments in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner \\n\\nthat it deems necessary to correct any arithmetical or accounting \\nerrors that may have been made for any Plan Year;\\n\\n6.  to correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsis-\\n\\ntency in such manner and to such extent as will be deemed neces-\\nsary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the Plan; and\\n\\n7.  if the Plan permits a form of distribution other than a lump sum, and \\na Participant elects such form of distribution, the Plan Administrator \\nmay place that Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account into a segregated \\nInvestment Fund for the purpose of maintaining the necessary liquid-\\nity to provide beneï¬\\x81 t installments on a periodic basis. \\n\\n7.04 Expenses and Compensation\\n\\nAll reasonable expenses of administration, including, but not limited to, \\nthose involved in retaining necessary professional assistance, may be \\npaid from the assets of the Fund. Alternatively, the Employer may, in its \\ndiscretion, pay any or all such expenses. Pursuant to uniform and non-\\ndiscriminatory rules that the Plan Administrator may establish from time \\nto time, administrative expenses and expenses unique to a particular \\nParticipant or group of Participants may be charged to the Individual \\nAccount of such Participant or may be assessed against terminated \\nParticipants even if not assessed against active Participants (subject to \\nrules promulgated by the IRS and the DOL), or the Plan Administrator \\nmay allow Participants to pay such fees outside of the Plan. The \\nEmployer shall furnish the Plan Administrator with such clerical and \\nother assistance as the Plan Administrator may need in the perfor-\\nmance of their duties.\\n\\n7.05 Information from Employer\\n\\nTo enable the Plan Administrator to perform their duties, the Employer \\nshall supply complete, accurate, and timely information to the Plan \\nAdministrator (or their designated agents) on all matters relating to the \\nCompensation of all Participants; their regular employment; retirement, \\ndeath, Disability, Severance from Employment, or Termination of \\nEmployment; and such other pertinent facts as the Plan Administrator \\n(or their agents) may require. The Plan Administrator shall advise the \\nTrustee (or Custodian, if applicable) of such of the preceding facts as \\nmay be pertinent to the Trusteeâ\\x80\\x99s (or Custodianâ\\x80\\x99s) duties under the Plan. \\nThe Plan Administrator (or their agents) is entitled to rely on such infor-\\nmation as is supplied by the Employer and will have no duty or responsi-\\nbility to verify such information. Such information, including \\nauthorizations and directions, may be exchanged among the Employer, \\nthe Plan Administrator, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), or their \\nagents through electronic, telephonic, or other means (including, for \\nexample, through the internet) pursuant to applicable servicing arrange-\\nments in effect for the Plan.\\n\\nIndividual 401(k) Basic Plan Document  25\\n\\n\\x0c7.06 Plan Amendments\\n\\nA.  Right of Prototype Document Sponsor to Amend the Plan or \\nTerminate Sponsorship\\n\\n1.  The Employer, by adopting the Plan, expressly delegates to the \\n\\nPrototype Document Sponsor the power, but not the duty, to amend \\nthe Plan without any further action or consent of the Employer as \\nthe Prototype Document Sponsor deems either necessary for the \\npurpose of adjusting the Plan to comply with all laws and regulations \\ngoverning pension or proï¬\\x81 t sharing plans or desirable to the extent \\nconsistent with such laws and regulations. Speciï¬\\x81 cally, it is under-\\nstood that the amendments may be made unilaterally by the \\nPrototype Document Sponsor. However, it will be understood that the \\nPrototype Document Sponsor will be under no obligation to amend \\nthe Plan documents, and the Employer expressly waives any rights or \\nclaims against the Prototype Document Sponsor for not exercising \\nthis power to amend. For purposes of Prototype Document Sponsor \\namendments, the mass submitter will generally be recognized as the \\nagent of the Prototype Document Sponsor. If the Prototype \\nDocument Sponsor does not adopt IRS model amendments adopted \\nby the mass submitter, the Plan will no longer be identical to or a \\nminor modiï¬\\x81 er of the mass submitter plan and will be considered an \\nindividually designed plan. Notwithstanding the preceding, the adop-\\ntion of good faith IRS amendments must be accomplished pursuant \\nto the rules for each such amendment as prescribed by the IRS.', 'However, for purposes of reliance on an opinion letter, the Prototype \\n\\nDocument Sponsor will no longer have the authority to amend the \\nPlan on behalf of the Employer as of the date the Employer amends \\nthe Plan to incorporate a type of plan that is not permitted under the \\nprototype program, or as of the date the IRS notiï¬\\x81 es the Employer \\nthat the Plan is an individually designed plan due to the nature and \\nextent of the Employerâ\\x80\\x99s amendments to the Plan.\\n\\n2.  An amendment by the Prototype Document Sponsor will be accom-\\n\\nplished by giving notice (either in writing or in any other form permit-\\nted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the Adopting \\nEmployer of the amendment to be made. The notice will set forth the \\ntext of such amendment and the date such amendment is to be \\neffective. Such amendment will take effect unless within the 30-day \\nperiod after such notice is provided, or within such shorter period as \\nthe notice may specify, the Adopting Employer gives the Prototype \\nDocument Sponsor written notice of refusal to consent to the \\namendment. Such written notice of refusal will have the effect of \\nwithdrawing the Plan as a prototype plan and will cause the Plan to \\nbe considered an individually designed plan. \\n\\n3.  In addition to the amendment rights described above, the Prototype \\nDocument Sponsor will have the right to terminate its sponsorship of \\nthis Plan by providing notice (either in writing or in any other form \\npermitted under rules promulgated by the IRS and DOL) to the \\nAdopting Employer of such termination. Such termination of sponsor-\\nship will have the effect of withdrawing the Plan as a prototype plan \\nand will cause the Plan to be considered an individually designed \\nplan. The Prototype Document Sponsor will have the right to termi-\\nnate its sponsorship of this Plan regardless of whether the Prototype \\nDocument Sponsor has terminated sponsorship with respect to other \\nemployers adopting its prototype Plan.\\n\\nB.  Right of Adopting Employer to Amend the Planâ\\x80\\x94The Adopting \\nEmployer may amend the Plan to \\n\\n1.  change options previously selected in the Adoption Agreement; \\n\\n2.  add overriding language in the Adoption Agreement when such lan-\\n\\nguage is necessary to satisfy Code section 415 or Code section 416 \\nbecause of the required aggregation of multiple plans;\\n\\n3.  amend administrative provisions of the trust or custodial document \\n\\nin the case of a nonstandardized plan and make more limited \\namendments in the case of a standardized plan, such as the name \\nof the Plan, Employer, Trustee or Custodian, Plan Administrator and \\nother Fiduciaries, the trust year, and the name of pooled trust in \\nwhich the Planâ\\x80\\x99s trust will participate;\\n\\n4.  add certain sample and model amendments published by the IRS or \\nother required good faith amendments, that speciï¬\\x81 cally provide that \\ntheir adoption will not cause the Plan to be treated as individually \\ndesigned; and\\n\\n5.  add or change provisions permitted under the Plan or specify or \\n\\nchange the Effective Date of a provision as permitted under the Plan.\\n\\nAn Adopting Employer that amends the Plan for any other reason, includ-\\ning a waiver of the minimum funding requirement under Code section \\n412(d), will no longer participate in this prototype plan and will be con-\\nsidered to have an individually designed plan.\\n\\nAn Adopting Employer who wishes to amend the Plan shall document \\nthe amendment in writing, executed by a duly authorized ofï¬\\x81 cer of the \\nAdopting Employer. If the amendment is in the form of a restated \\nAdoption Agreement, the amendment will become effective on the date \\nprovided in the Adoption Agreement. Any other amendment will become \\neffective as described therein upon execution by the Adopting Employer \\nand, if appropriate, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). A copy of a \\nrestated Adoption Agreement or other amendment must be provided to \\nthe Prototype Document Sponsor and the Trustee (or Custodian, if \\napplicable) before the effective date of the amendment.\\n\\nThe Adopting Employer further reserves the right to replace the Plan in \\nits entirety by adopting another retirement plan which the Adopting \\nEmployer designates as a replacement plan.\\n\\nC.  Limitation on Power to Amendâ\\x80\\x94No amendment to the Plan will be \\neffective to the extent that it has the effect of decreasing a \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s accrued beneï¬\\x81 t. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, \\na Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account may be reduced to the extent permit-\\nted under Code section 412(d)(2) or to the extent permitted under \\nTreasury Regulations sections 1.411(d)-3 and 1.411(d)-4. For purposes \\nof this paragraph, a Plan amendment that has the effect of decreasing \\na Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account with respect to beneï¬\\x81 ts attributable to \\nservice before the amendment will be treated as reducing an accrued \\nbeneï¬\\x81 t. For purposes of this paragraph, a Participant will not accrue a \\nright to an allocation of an Employer Proï¬\\x81 t Sharing Contribution or \\nEmployer Money Purchase Pension Contribution for the current Plan \\nYear until the last day of such Plan Year and after the application of all \\namendments required or permitted by the IRS. \\n\\nNo amendment to the Plan will be effective to eliminate or restrict an \\noptional form of beneï¬\\x81 t. The preceding sentence will not apply to a Plan \\namendment that eliminates or restricts the ability of a Participant to \\nreceive payment of their Individual Account under a particular optional \\nform of beneï¬\\x81 t if the amendment provides a single-sum distribution \\nform. Where this Plan document is being adopted to amend another \\nplan that contains a protected beneï¬\\x81 t not provided for in this document, \\nthe Employer must complete a â\\x80\\x9cProtected Beneï¬\\x81 t and Prior Plan \\nDocument Provisions Attachment,â\\x80\\x9d describing such protected beneï¬\\x81 t \\nwhich, will become part of the Plan.\\n\\n7.07 Plan Merger or Consolidation\\n\\nIn the case of any merger or consolidation of the Plan with, or transfer of \\nassets or liabilities of such Plan to, any other plan, each Participant will \\nbe entitled to receive beneï¬\\x81 ts immediately after the merger, consolida-\\ntion, or transfer (if the Plan had then terminated) that are equal to or \\ngreater than the beneï¬\\x81 ts they would have been entitled to receive imme-\\ndiately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the Plan had then \\nterminated). The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) has the authority to \\nenter into merger agreements or agreements to directly transfer the \\nassets of this Plan, but only if such agreements are made with trustees \\nor custodians of other retirement plans described in Code section 401(a) \\nor such other plans permitted by laws or regulations. If it is later deter-\\nmined that all or part of a non-elective transfer was ineligible to be \\ntransferred into the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall direct that any \\nineligible amounts, plus earnings or losses attributable thereto (deter-\\nmined in the manner described in Plan Section7.02(B)), be returned to \\nthe transferor plan or correct the ineligible transfer using any other \\nmethod permitted by the IRS under regulation or other guidance.\\n\\n26 Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document\\n\\n\\x0c7.08 Permanency\\n\\n7.14 Headings\\n\\nThe Employer expects to continue this Plan and make the necessary \\ncontributions thereto indeï¬\\x81 nitely, but such continuance and payment is \\nnot assumed as a contractual obligation. Neither the Adoption \\nAgreement nor the Plan nor any amendment or modiï¬\\x81 cation thereof nor \\nthe making of contributions hereunder will be construed as giving any \\nParticipant or any other person any legal or equitable right against the \\nEmployer, the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), the Plan \\nAdministrator, or the Prototype Document Sponsor except as speciï¬\\x81 cally \\nprovided herein, or as provided by law.\\n\\n7.09 Method and Procedure for Termination\\n\\nThe Plan may be terminated by the Adopting Employer at any time by \\nappropriate action of its managing body. Such termination will be effec-\\ntive on the date speciï¬\\x81 ed by the Adopting Employer. The Plan shall \\nterminate, if required by either the IRS or the DOL, if the Adopting \\nEmployer is dissolved or terminated. Written notice of the termination \\nand effective date thereof will be given to the Trustee (or Custodian, if \\napplicable), Plan Administrator, Prototype Document Sponsor, and the \\nParticipants and Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries of deceased Participants. The required \\nï¬\\x81 lings (such as the Form 5500 series and others) must be made by the \\nAdopting Employer with the IRS and any other regulatory body as \\nrequired by current laws and regulations. Until all of the assets have \\nbeen distributed from the Fund, the Adopting Employer must keep the \\nPlan in compliance with current laws and regulations by making appro-\\npriate amendments to the Plan and by taking such other measures as \\nmay be required. If the Plan is abandoned by the Adopting Employer, \\nhowever, a qualiï¬\\x81 ed termination administrator (QTA) (or other entity \\npermitted by the IRS or DOL) may terminate the Plan according to rules \\npromulgated by the IRS and DOL.\\n\\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, a reversion to the \\nEmployer of amounts contributed to the Plan that exceed the limitations \\nimposed under Code section 415(c) may occur upon termination of the \\nPlan according to rules promulgated by the IRS. \\n\\n7.10 Continuance of Plan by Successor Employer\\n\\nNotwithstanding the preceding Plan Section 7.09, a successor of the \\nAdopting Employer may continue the Plan and be substituted in the \\nplace of the present Adopting Employer. The successor and the present \\nAdopting Employer (or, if deceased, the executor of the estate of a \\ndeceased Self-Employed Individual who was the Adopting Employer) must \\nexecute a written instrument authorizing such substitution, and the \\nsuccessor shall amend the Plan in accordance with Plan Section 7.06.\\n\\n7.11 Failure of Plan Qualiï¬\\x81 cation\\n\\nIf the Plan fails to retain its qualiï¬\\x81 ed status, the Plan will no longer be \\nconsidered to be part of a prototype plan, and such Employer can no \\nlonger participate under this prototype. In such event, the Plan will be \\nconsidered an individually designed plan.\\n\\n7.12 Governing Laws and Provisions\\n\\nTo the extent such laws are not preempted by federal law, the terms and \\nconditions of this Plan will be governed by the laws of the state in which \\nthe Prototype Document Sponsor is located, unless otherwise agreed to \\nin writing by the Prototype Document Sponsor and the Employer.\\n\\nIn the event of any conï¬\\x82 ict between the provisions of this Basic Plan \\nDocument and provisions of the Adoption Agreement, the summary \\nplan description, or any related documents, the Basic Plan Document \\nwill control.\\n\\n7.13 State Community Property Laws\\n\\nThe terms and conditions of this Plan will be applicable without regard \\nto the community property laws of any state.\\n\\nS\\ne\\nc\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n\\nThe headings of the Plan have been inserted for convenience of reference \\nonly and are to be ignored in any construction of the provisions hereof.\\n\\n7.15 Gender and Number\\n\\nWhenever any words are used herein in the masculine gender, they will \\nbe construed as though they were also used in the feminine gender in \\nall cases where they would so apply, and whenever any words are used \\nherein in the singular form, they will be construed as though they were \\nalso used in the plural form in all cases where they would so apply.\\n\\n7.16 Standard of Fiduciary Conduct\\n\\nThe Employer, Plan Administrator, Trustee, and any other Fiduciary under \\nthis Plan shall discharge their duties with respect to this Plan solely in \\nthe interests of Participants and their Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries, and with the care, \\nskill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing \\nthat a prudent person acting in like capacity and familiar with such \\nmatters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character \\nand with like aims. No Fiduciary will cause the Plan to engage in any \\ntransaction known as a â\\x80\\x9cnon-exempt prohibited transactionâ\\x80\\x9d under \\neither the Code or ERISA.\\n\\n7.17 General Undertaking of all Parties\\n\\nAll parties to this Plan and all persons claiming any interest whatsoever \\nhereunder agree to perform any and all acts and execute any and all \\ndocuments and papers that may be necessary or desirable for the \\ncarrying out of this Plan and any of its provisions.\\n\\n7.18 Agreement Binds Heirs, Etc.\\n\\nThis Plan shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, \\nsuccessors, and assigns as those terms will apply to any and all parties \\nhereto, present and future.\\n\\n7.19 Determination of Top-Heavy Status \\n\\nA.  In Generalâ\\x80\\x94Except as provided in Plan Section 7.19(B), this Plan is \\na Top-Heavy Plan if any of the following conditions exist:\\n\\n1.  if the top-heavy ratio for this Plan exceeds 60 percent and this Plan \\n\\nis not part of any Required Aggregation Group or Permissive \\nAggregation Group of plans;\\n\\n2.  if this Plan is part of a Required Aggregation Group of plans but not \\n\\npart of a Permissive Aggregation Group and the top-heavy ratio for \\nthe group of plans exceeds 60 percent; or\\n\\n3.  if this Plan is a part of a Required Aggregation Group and part of a \\nPermissive Aggregation Group of plans and the top-heavy ratio for \\nthe Permissive Aggregation Group exceeds 60 percent.\\n\\nB.  Top-Heavy Ratio\\n\\n1.  If the Employer maintains one or more deï¬\\x81 ned contribution plans \\n(including any simpliï¬\\x81 ed employee pension plan) and the Employer \\nhas not maintained any deï¬\\x81 ned beneï¬\\x81 t plan that during the ï¬\\x81 ve-year \\nperiod ending on the Determination Date(s) has or has had accrued \\nbeneï¬\\x81 ts, the top-heavy ratio for this Plan alone or for the Required \\nor Permissive Aggregation Group as appropriate is a fraction, the \\nnumerator of which is the sum of the account balances of all Key \\nEmployees as of the Determination Date(s) (including any part of any \\naccount balance distributed in the one-year period ending on the \\nDetermination Date(s) (ï¬\\x81 ve-year period ending on the Determination \\nDate in the case of a distribution made for a reason other than \\nSeverance from Employment, death, or Disability and in determining \\nwhether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before \\nJanuary 1, 2002)) and the denominator of which is the sum of all \\naccount balances (including any part of any account balance distrib-\\nuted in the one-year period ending on the Determination Date(s), \\n(ï¬\\x81 ve-year period ending on the Determination Date in the case of a \\ndistribution made for a reason other than Severance from \\nEmployment, death, or Disability and in determining whether the Plan \\n\\nIndividual 401(k) Basic Plan Document  27\\n\\n\\x0cis top-heavy for Plan Years beginning before January 1, 2002)) both \\ncomputed in accordance with Code section 416 and the correspond-\\ning regulations. Both the numerator and the denominator of the \\ntop-heavy ratio are increased to reï¬\\x82 ect any contribution not actually \\nmade as of the Determination Date, but that is required to be taken \\ninto account on that date under Code section 416 and the corre-\\nsponding regulations.\\n\\n2.  If the Employer maintains one or more deï¬\\x81 ned contribution plans \\n(including any simpliï¬\\x81 ed employee pension plan) and the Employer \\nmaintains or has maintained one or more deï¬\\x81 ned beneï¬\\x81 t plans that \\nduring the ï¬\\x81 ve-year period ending on the Determination Date(s) has \\nor has had any accrued beneï¬\\x81 ts, the top-heavy ratio for any \\nRequired or Permissive Aggregation Group, as appropriate, is a \\nfraction, the numerator of which is the sum of account balances \\nunder the aggregated deï¬\\x81 ned contribution plan or plans for all Key \\nEmployees, determined in accordance with 1) above, and the \\nPresent Value of accrued beneï¬\\x81 ts under the aggregated deï¬\\x81 ned \\nbeneï¬\\x81 t plan or plans for all Key Employees as of the Determination \\nDate(s), and the denominator of which is the sum of the account \\nbalances under the aggregated deï¬\\x81 ned contribution plan or plans for \\nall Participants, determined in accordance with 1) above, and the \\nPresent Value of accrued beneï¬\\x81 ts under the deï¬\\x81 ned beneï¬\\x81 t plan or \\nplans for all Participants as of the Determination Date(s), all deter-\\nmined in accordance with Code section 416 and the corresponding \\nregulations. The accrued beneï¬\\x81 ts under a deï¬\\x81 ned beneï¬\\x81 t plan in \\nboth the numerator and denominator of the top-heavy ratio are \\nincreased for any distribution of an accrued beneï¬\\x81 t made in the \\none-year period ending on the Determination Date (ï¬\\x81 ve-year period \\nending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution made \\nfor a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or \\nDisability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan \\nYears beginning before January 1, 2002).\\n\\n3.  For purposes of (1) and (2) above, the value of account balances and \\n\\nthe Present Value of accrued beneï¬\\x81 ts will be determined as of the \\nmost recent Valuation Date that falls within or ends with the \\n12-month period ending on the Determination Date, except as pro-\\nvided in Code section 416 and the corresponding regulations for the \\nï¬\\x81 rst and second plan years of a deï¬\\x81 ned beneï¬\\x81 t plan. The account \\nbalances and accrued beneï¬\\x81 ts of a Participant 1) who is not a Key \\nEmployee but who was a Key Employee in a prior year, or 2) who has \\nnot been credited with at least one Hour of Service with any employer \\nmaintaining the plan at any time during the one-year period (ï¬\\x81 ve-year \\nperiod ending on the Determination Date in the case of a distribution \\nmade for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death, or \\nDisability and in determining whether the Plan is top-heavy for Plan \\nYears beginning before January 1, 2002) ending on the Determination \\nDate will be disregarded. The calculation of the top-heavy ratio, and \\nthe extent to which distributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken \\ninto account will be made in accordance with Code section 416 and \\nthe corresponding regulations. Deductible employee contributions will \\nnot be taken into account for purposes of computing the top-heavy \\nratio. When aggregating plans, the value of account balances and \\naccrued beneï¬\\x81 ts will be calculated with reference to the \\nDetermination Dates that fall within the same calendar year.', 'The accrued beneï¬\\x81 t of a Participant other than a Key Employee will \\nbe determined under 1) the method, if any, that uniformly applies for \\naccrual purposes under all deï¬\\x81 ned beneï¬\\x81 t plans maintained by the \\nEmployer, or 2) if there is no such method, as if such beneï¬\\x81 t \\naccrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted \\nunder the fractional rule of Code section 411(b)(1)(C).\\n\\n7.20 Inalienability of Beneï¬\\x81 ts\\n\\nNo beneï¬\\x81 t or interest available under the Plan will be subject to assign-\\nment or alienation, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The preceding sen-\\ntence will not apply to judgments and settlements described in Code \\nsection 401(a)(13)(C) and ERISA section 206(d)(4). Such sentence will, \\nhowever, apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any \\nbeneï¬\\x81 t payable with respect to a Participant pursuant to a Domestic \\nRelations Order, unless such order is determined to be a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed \\nDomestic Relations Order as deï¬\\x81 ned in the Deï¬\\x81 nitions Section of the Plan.\\n\\nGenerally, a Domestic Relations Order cannot be a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic \\nRelations Order until January 1, 1985. However, in the case of a Domestic \\nRelations Order entered before January 1, 1985, the Plan Administrator:\\n\\n1.  shall treat such order as a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order if the \\n\\nPlan Administrator is paying beneï¬\\x81 ts pursuant to such order on \\nJanuary 1, 1985; and\\n\\n2.  may treat any other such order entered before January 1, 1985, as a \\nQualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order even if such order does not meet \\nthe requirements of Code section 414(p).', 'Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, a distribu-\\n\\ntion to an Alternate Payee under a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations \\nOrder will be permitted even if the Participant affected by such order \\nis not otherwise entitled to a distribution, and even if such \\nParticipant has not attained the earliest retirement age as deï¬\\x81 ned in \\nCode section 414(p).\\n\\n7.21 Bonding\\n\\nEvery Fiduciary and every person who handles funds or other property of \\nthe Plan shall be bonded to the extent required by ERISA section 412 \\nand the corresponding regulations for purposes of protecting the Plan \\nagainst loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on the part of the \\nperson, group, or class, alone or in connivance with others, to be cov-\\nered by such bond. The amount of the bond will be ï¬\\x81 xed at the begin-\\nning of each Plan Year and will not be less than ten-percent of the \\namount of funds handled. The amount of funds handled will be deter-\\nmined by the funds handled the previous Plan Year or, if none, the \\namount of funds estimated, in accordance with rules provided by the \\nSecretary of Labor, to be handled during the current Plan Year. \\nNotwithstanding the preceding, no bond will be less than $1,000 nor \\nmore than $500,000, except that the Secretary of Labor will have the \\nright to prescribe an amount in excess of $500,000. In the case of a \\nPlan that holds employer securities (within the meaning of ERISA sec-\\ntion 407(d)(1)), the maximum bond amount is $1,000,000 or such other \\namount as the Secretary of Labor prescribes.\\n\\n7.22 Investment Authority\\n\\nA.  Plan Investmentsâ\\x80\\x94Except as provided in Plan Section 7.22(B) (relat-\\ning to individual direction of investments by Participants), the Adopting \\nEmployer, not the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable), will have exclu-\\nsive management and control over the investment of the Fund into any \\npermitted investment. The Adopting Employer will be responsible for \\nestablishing a funding policy statement on behalf of the Plan and shall \\nprovide a copy of such funding policy statement to the Discretionary \\nTrustee, if any. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Trustee is desig-\\nnated as a Discretionary Trustee in the Adoption Agreement, such \\nDiscretionary Trustee may enter into an agreement with the Adopting \\nEmployer whereby the Discretionary Trustee will manage the investment \\nof all or a portion of the Fund. Any such agreement will be in writing and \\nwill set forth such matters as the Discretionary Trustee deems neces-\\nsary or desirable.\\n\\nB.  Direction of Investments by Participantsâ\\x80\\x94Each Participant will have \\nthe responsibility for directing the Trustee (or Custodian, if provided for \\nunder a separate agreement between the Adopting Employer and the \\nCustodian), regarding the investment of all or part of their Individual \\nAccount. If all of the requirements pertaining to Participant direction of \\ninvestment in ERISA section 404(c)(1) are satisï¬\\x81 ed, then to the extent \\nso directed, the Adopting Employer, Plan Administrator, Trustee, \\nCustodian (if applicable), and all other Fiduciaries are relieved of \\nFiduciary liability under ERISA section 404. \\n\\nThe Plan Administrator shall direct that a Separate Fund be established \\nin the name of each Participant who directs the investment of part or all \\nof their Individual Account. Each Separate Fund will be charged or cred-\\nited (as appropriate) with the earnings, gains, losses, or expenses \\nattributable to such Separate Fund. No Fiduciary will be liable for any \\nloss that results from a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s individual direction. The assets \\nsubject to individual direction will not be invested in collectibles as that \\nterm is deï¬\\x81 ned in Code section 408(m). \\n\\n28 Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document\\n\\n\\x0cThe Plan Administrator shall establish such uniform and nondiscrimina-\\ntory rules relating to individual direction as it deems necessary or advis-\\nable including, but not limited to, rules describing 1) which portions of \\nParticipantsâ\\x80\\x99 Individual Accounts can be individually directed, 2) the \\nfrequency of investment changes, 3) the forms and procedures for \\nmaking investment changes, and 4) the effect of a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s failure \\nto make a valid direction. \\n\\nThe Plan Administrator may, in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, \\nlimit the available investments for Participantsâ\\x80\\x99 individual direction to \\ncertain speciï¬\\x81 ed investment options (including, but not limited to, cer-\\ntain mutual funds, investment contracts, deposit accounts, and group \\ntrusts). The Plan Administrator may permit, in a uniform and nondis-\\ncriminatory manner, a Beneï¬\\x81 ciary of a deceased Participant or the \\nAlternate Payee under a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order to individu-\\nally direct investments in accordance with this Plan Section 7.22(B). \\n\\nNotwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, if the Adoption \\nAgreement names a Directed Trustee, such Participants will furnish \\ninvestment instruction to the Plan Administrator under procedures \\nadopted by the Adopting Employer and/or the Plan Administrator consis-\\ntent with the Plan, and it will be the responsibility of the Plan \\nAdministrator to provide direction to the Directed Trustee regarding the \\ninvestment of such amounts. If a Participant who has the right to direct \\ninvestments under the terms of the Plan fails to provide such direction \\nto the Plan Administrator, the Plan Administrator shall direct the invest-\\nment of such Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Accounts. The Plan Administrator \\nshall maintain records showing the interest of each Participant and/or \\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciary in the Fund unless the Directed Trustee enters into a written \\nagreement with the Adopting Employer to keep separate accounts for \\neach such Participant or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary. \\n\\nC.  Investment Managers\\n\\n1.  Deï¬\\x81 nition of Investment Managerâ\\x80\\x94The Adopting Employer may \\nappoint one or more investment managers to make investment \\ndecisions with respect to all or a portion of the Fund. The invest-\\nment manager will be any ï¬\\x81 rm or individual registered as an invest-\\nment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a bank as \\ndeï¬\\x81 ned in said Act, or an insurance company qualiï¬\\x81 ed under the \\nlaws of more than one state to perform services consisting of the \\nmanagement, acquisition, or disposition of any assets of the Plan. \\n\\n2.  Investment Managerâ\\x80\\x99s Authorityâ\\x80\\x94A separate Investment Fund will be \\n\\nestablished representing the assets of the Fund invested at the \\ndirection of the investment manager. The investment manager so \\nappointed shall direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) with \\nrespect to the investment of such Investment Fund. The investments \\nthat may be acquired at the direction of the investment manager are \\nthose described in Plan Section 7.22(D). \\n\\n3.  Written Agreementâ\\x80\\x94The appointment of any investment manager will \\n\\nbe by written agreement between the Adopting Employer and the \\ninvestment manager, and a copy of such agreement (and any modiï¬\\x81 -\\ncation or termination thereof) must be given to the Trustee (or \\nCustodian, if applicable). The agreement will set forth, among other \\nmatters, the effective date of the investment managerâ\\x80\\x99s appointment \\nand an acknowledgment by the investment manager that it is a \\nFiduciary of the Plan under ERISA. \\n\\n4.  Concerning the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable)â\\x80\\x94Written notice \\nof each appointment of an investment manager will be given to the \\nTrustee (or Custodian, if applicable) at least 30 days in advance of \\nthe effective date of such appointment. Such notice will specify \\nwhich portion of the Fund will constitute the Investment Fund subject \\nto the investment managerâ\\x80\\x99s direction. The Trustee (or Custodian, if \\napplicable) will comply with the investment direction given to it by \\nthe investment manager and will not be liable for any loss which may \\nresult by reason of any action (or inaction) it takes at the direction of \\nthe investment manager.\\n\\nD.  Permissible Investmentsâ\\x80\\x94The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) \\nmay invest the assets of the Plan in property of any character, real or \\npersonal, including, but not limited to, the following: stocks, including \\nQualifying Employer Securities, and including shares of open-end invest-\\n\\nS\\ne\\nc\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n\\nment companies (mutual funds); bonds; notes; debentures; proprietary \\nmutual funds; deposit accounts; options; limited partnership interests; \\nmortgages; real estate or any interests therein (including Qualifying \\nEmployer Real Property); unit investment trusts; Treasury Bills, and \\nother U.S. Government obligations; common trust funds, combined \\ninvestment trusts, collective trust funds or commingled funds main-\\ntained by a bank or similar ï¬\\x81 nancial organization (whether or not the \\nTrustee hereunder); savings accounts, certiï¬\\x81 cates of deposit, demand \\nor time deposits or money market accounts of a bank or similar ï¬\\x81 nan-\\ncial organization (whether or not the Trustee hereunder); annuity con-\\ntracts that are â\\x80\\x9cguaranteed beneï¬\\x81 t policies,â\\x80\\x9d as deï¬\\x81 ned in ERISA \\nsection 401(b)(2)(B); life insurance policies; or in such other invest-\\nments as is deemed proper without regard to investments authorized by \\nstatute or rule of law governing the investment of trust funds but with \\nregard to ERISA and this Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, \\nthe Prototype Document Sponsor may, as a condition of making the \\nPlan available to the Adopting Employer, limit the types of property in \\nwhich the assets of the Plan may be invested. The list of permissible \\ninvestment options will be further limited in accordance with any appli-\\ncable law, regulations, or other restrictions applicable to the Trustee or \\nCustodian, including, but not limited to, internal operational procedures \\nadopted by such Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). The actions of a \\nDiscretionary Trustee named in the Adoption Agreement will also be \\nsubject to the funding policy statement provided by the Adopting \\nEmployer. If any Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) invests all or any \\nportion of the Fund pursuant to written instructions provided by the \\nAdopting Employer (including an investment manager appointed by the \\nAdopting Employer pursuant to Plan Section 7.22(C)) or any Participant \\npursuant to Plan Section 7.22(B), the Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-\\ncable) will be deemed to have invested pursuant to the Adopting \\nEmployerâ\\x80\\x99s funding policy statement.\\n\\nTo the extent the assets of the Plan are invested in a group trust, \\nincluding a collective trust fund or commingled funds maintained by a \\nbank or similar ï¬\\x81 nancial organization, the declaration of trust of such \\ncomposite trust will be deemed to be a part of the Plan, and any invest-\\nment in such composite trust will be subject to all of the provisions of \\nsuch declaration of trust, as the same may be amended or supple-\\nmented from time to time.\\n\\nIf the responsibility for directing investments for Elective Deferrals (and \\nearnings) is executed by someone other than the Participants, the acqui-\\nsition of Qualifying Employer Securities and Qualifying Employer Real \\nProperty will be limited to ten-percent of the fair market value of the \\nassets of the Plan, to the extent required by ERISA section 407(b)(2). \\n\\nE.  Matters Relating to Insurance\\n\\n1.  Unless prohibited by the Plan Sponsor pursuant to Plan Section \\n\\n7.22(D), a life insurance contract may be purchased on behalf of a \\nParticipant. No life insurance contract may be purchased unless the \\ninsured under the contract is the Participant, the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nSpouse or another individual in whom the Participant has an insur-\\nable interest. If a life insurance contract is to be purchased for a \\nParticipant, the aggregate premium for certain life insurance for \\neach Participant must be less than a certain percentage of the \\naggregate Employer Contributions allocated to a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nIndividual Account at any particular time as follows. \\n\\na.  Ordinary Life Insuranceâ\\x80\\x94For purposes of these incidental insur-\\n\\nance provisions, ordinary life insurance contracts are contracts with \\nboth nondecreasing death beneï¬\\x81 ts and nonincreasing premiums. If \\nsuch contracts are purchased, less than 50 percent of the aggre-\\ngate Employer Contributions allocated to any Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual \\nAccount will be used to pay the premiums attributable to them. \\n\\nb.  Term and Universal Life Insuranceâ\\x80\\x94No more than 25 percent of \\n\\nthe aggregate Employer Contributions allocated to any Participantâ\\x80\\x99s \\nIndividual Account will be used to pay the premiums on term life \\ninsurance contracts, universal life insurance contracts, and all \\nother life insurance contracts that are not ordinary life. \\n\\nIndividual 401(k) Basic Plan Document  29\\n\\n\\x0cc.  Combinationâ\\x80\\x94The sum of 50 percent of the ordinary life insurance \\npremiums and all other life insurance premiums will not exceed 25 \\npercent of the aggregate Employer Contributions allocated to any \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account. \\n\\nThe above incidental beneï¬\\x81 ts limits do not apply to life insurance con-\\ntracts (1) purchased by an Employee who has been a Participant in the \\nPlan for ï¬\\x81 ve or more years, (2) purchased with Employer Contributions \\nthat have been in the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account for at least two \\nfull Plan Years, measured from the date such contributions were allo-\\ncated or (3) purchased using rollover contributions. For purposes of this \\nPlan Section 7.22(E)(1), transfer contributions will be considered \\nEmployer Contributions, and therefore may be used to pay contract \\npremiums. No part of the Deductible Employee Contribution account will \\nbe used to purchase life insurance.\\n\\n2.  Any dividends or credits earned on insurance contracts for a \\n\\nParticipant will be allocated to such Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Individual Account \\nderived from Employer Contributions for whose beneï¬\\x81 t the contract \\nis held. \\n\\n3.  Subject to Plan Section 5.10, the contracts on a Participantâ\\x80\\x99s life \\n\\nwill be converted to cash or an annuity or distributed to the \\nParticipant upon separation from service with the Employer. In addi-\\ntion, contracts on the joint lives of a Participant and another person \\nmay not be maintained under this Plan if such Participant ceases to \\nhave an insurable interest in such other person. \\n\\n4.  The Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable) shall apply for and will be \\n\\nthe owner of any insurance contract(s) purchased under the terms of \\nthis Plan. The insurance contract(s) must provide that proceeds will \\nbe payable to the Trustee (or Custodian, if applicable). However, the \\nTrustee (or Custodian, if applicable) will be required to pay over all \\nproceeds of the contract(s) to the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Designated \\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciary in accordance with the distribution provisions of this \\nPlan. A Participantâ\\x80\\x99s Spouse will be the designated beneï¬\\x81 ciary of the \\nproceeds in all circumstances unless a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Election has been \\nmade in accordance with Plan Section 5.10. Under no circumstances \\nwill the Fund retain any part of the proceeds. In the event of any \\nconï¬\\x82 ict between the terms of this Plan and the terms of any insur-\\nance contract purchased hereunder, the Plan provisions will control. \\n\\n5.  The Plan Administrator may direct the Trustee (or Custodian, if appli-\\n\\ncable) to sell and distribute insurance or annuity contracts to a \\nParticipant (or other party as may be permitted) in accordance with \\napplicable law or regulations. \\n\\n6.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, and except as may be \\notherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify and hold \\nharmless the insurer, its ofï¬\\x81 cers, directors, employees, agents, \\nheirs, executors, successors, and assigns, from and against any and \\nall liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements, losses, costs, \\ncharges, or expenses (including legal expenses) at any time arising \\nout of or incurred in connection with any action taken by such par-\\nties in the performance of their duties with respect to this Plan, \\nunless there has been a ï¬\\x81 nal adjudication of gross negligence or \\nwillful misconduct in the performance of such duties.', 'Further, except as may be otherwise provided by ERISA, the \\nEmployer will indemnify the insurer from any liability, claim, or \\nexpense (including legal expense) that the insurer incurs by reason \\nof, or which results in whole or in part from, the reliance of the \\ninsurer on the facts and other directions and elections the Employer \\ncommunicates or fails to communicate.\\n\\nF.  Diversiï¬\\x81 cation Requirements When Employer Securities are Held as \\nInvestments in the Planâ\\x80\\x94For Plan Years beginning on or after January \\n1, 2007, Code section 401(a)(35) requires qualiï¬\\x81 ed retirement plans \\nthat hold employer securities to allow Participants, Alternate Payees \\nwith Individual Accounts under the Plan, or Beneï¬\\x81 ciaries of deceased \\nParticipants to diversify their investments. This Code section and other \\nrelevant guidance govern the diversiï¬\\x81 cation procedures, which include \\nthe following.\\n\\n1.  Employee Contributions and Elective Deferrals Invested in Employer \\nSecuritiesâ\\x80\\x94In the case of the portion of an Individual Account attrib-\\n\\n30 Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document\\n\\nutable to Nondeductible Employee Contributions and Elective \\nDeferrals (if applicable) that are invested in employer securities, the \\nParticipant, Alternate Payee, or Beneï¬\\x81 ciary, as applicable, may elect \\nto direct the Plan to divest any such securities and to reinvest an \\nequivalent amount in other investments that meet the investment \\noption requirements below. \\n\\n2.  Employer Contributions Invested in Employer Securitiesâ\\x80\\x94In the case \\n\\nof the portion of an Individual Account attributable to Employer \\nContributions other than Elective Deferrals that are invested in \\nemployer securities, a Participant who has completed at least three \\nYears of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable), an \\nAlternative Payee with respect to a Participant who has completed at \\nleast three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if appli-\\ncable), or a Beneï¬\\x81 ciary, as applicable, may elect to direct the Plan to \\ndivest any such securities and to reinvest an equivalent amount in \\nother investments that meet the investment option requirements \\nbelow. Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Plan provides for imme-\\ndiate vesting, the three years of service requirement will be satisï¬\\x81 ed \\non the day immediately preceding the third anniversary of the \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s date of hire.\\n\\n3.  Investment Optionsâ\\x80\\x94The diversiï¬\\x81 cation requirements above are met \\nif the Plan offers not less than three investment options, other than \\nemployer securities, to which a Participant, Alternate Payee, or \\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciary, as applicable may direct the proceeds from the divest-\\nment of employer securities, each of which is diversiï¬\\x81 ed and has \\nmaterially different risk and return characteristics. The Plan may limit \\nthe time for divestment and reinvestment to periodic, reasonable \\nopportunities that occur no less frequently than quarterly. Except as \\nprovided in regulations, the Plan must not impose employer securi-\\nties investment restrictions or conditions that are not imposed on \\nthe investment of other Plan assets (other than restrictions or condi-\\ntions imposed by securities laws or other relevant guidance) except \\nthat a Plan may allow for more frequent transfers to or from either a \\nstable value fund or a qualiï¬\\x81 ed default investment alternative.\\n\\n4.  Exception for Certain Plansâ\\x80\\x94The diversiï¬\\x81 cation requirement does \\nnot apply to a one-Participant retirement plan, an employee stock \\nownership plan (ESOP) if 1) there are no contributions or earnings in \\nthe ESOP that are held within such plan and that are subject to \\nCode sections 401(k) or (m), and 2) such plan is a separate plan for \\npurposes of Code section 414(l) with respect to any other deï¬\\x81 ned \\nbeneï¬\\x81 t plan or deï¬\\x81 ned contribution plan maintained by the same \\nemployer or employers, or to a retirement plan where employer \\nsecurities are held in an investment fund as described in Treasury \\nRegulation section 1.401(a)(35)-1(f)(2)(B)(3)(ii). \\n\\n5.  Transition Rule for Securities Attributable to Employer \\n\\nContributionsâ\\x80\\x94In the case of the portion of an Individual Account \\nattributable to Employer Contributions other than Elective Deferrals \\nthat are invested in employer securities, including, a Participant who \\nhas completed at least three Years of Vesting Service (Periods of \\nService, if applicable), an Alternate Payee with respect to a \\nParticipant who has completed at least three Years of Vesting \\nService (Periods of Service, if applicable), or a Beneï¬\\x81 ciary, as appli-\\ncable, the employer securities acquired in a Plan Year beginning \\nbefore January 1, 2007, will be subject to the following divestiture \\nand reinvestment transition schedule, which applies separately with \\nrespect to each class of securities. \\n\\nFor the Plan Year in which diversiï¬\\x81 cation requirement applies, the \\napplicable percentage subject to diversiï¬\\x81 cation is:', 'â\\x80¢ First   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   33%\\nâ\\x80¢ Second .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   66%\\nâ\\x80¢ Third   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .', '100%\\n\\nThis three-year phase-in requirement does not apply to a Participant \\nwho has attained age 55 and who has completed at least three \\nYears of Vesting Service (Periods of Service, if applicable) before the \\nï¬\\x81 rst Plan Year beginning after December 31, 2005.', 'Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Plan provides for immediate vesting, \\nthe three-years-of-service requirement will be satisï¬\\x81 ed on the day immedi-\\nately preceding the third anniversary of the Participantâ\\x80\\x99s date of hire.\\n\\n7.23 Procedures and Other Matters Regarding Domestic \\nRelations Orders\\n\\nA.  To the extent provided in any Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order, the \\nformer Spouse of a Participant will be treated as a surviving Spouse of \\nsuch Participant for purposes of any beneï¬\\x81 t payable in the form of \\neither a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Joint and Survivor Annuity or Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Preretirement \\nSurvivor Annuity.\\n\\nB.  The Plan will not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of \\nthe Code, which generally prohibits payment of beneï¬\\x81 ts before the \\nParticipantâ\\x80\\x99s Termination of Employment or Severance from Employment, \\nas applicable, with the Employer, solely by reason of payments to an \\nAlternate Payee pursuant to a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order.\\n\\nC.  In the case of any Domestic Relations Order received by the Plan: \\n\\n1.  the Plan Administrator shall promptly notify the Participant and any \\n\\nother Alternate Payee of the receipt of such order and the Planâ\\x80\\x99s \\nprocedure for determining the qualiï¬\\x81 ed status of Domestic Relations \\nOrders; and \\n\\n2.  within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the Plan \\nAdministrator shall determine whether such order is a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed \\nDomestic Relations Order and notify the Participant and each \\nAlternate Payee of such determination.\\n\\nThe Plan Administrator shall establish reasonable procedures to deter-\\nmine the qualiï¬\\x81 ed status of Domestic Relations Orders and to adminis-\\nter distributions under such qualiï¬\\x81 ed orders.\\n\\nD.  During any period in which the issue of whether a Domestic Relations \\nOrder is a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order is being determined by the \\nPlan Administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise, the \\nPlan Administrator shall segregate in a separate account in the Plan or \\nin an escrow account the amounts which would have been payable to \\nthe Alternate Payee during such period if the order had been determined \\nto be a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order. If within 18 months the \\norder or modiï¬\\x81 cation thereof is determined to be a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic \\nRelations Order, the Plan Administrator shall pay the segregated \\namounts (plus any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled \\nthereto. If within 18 months either 1) it is determined that the order is \\nnot a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order, or 2) the issue as to whether \\nsuch order is a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order is not resolved, then \\nthe Plan Administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (plus any inter-\\nest thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to \\nsuch amounts if there had been no order. Any determination that an \\norder is a Qualiï¬\\x81 ed Domestic Relations Order that is made after the \\nclose of the 18-month period will be applied prospectively only.\\n\\n7.24 Indemniï¬\\x81 cation of Prototype Document Sponsor \\n\\nNotwithstanding any other provision herein, and except as may be other-\\nwise provided by ERISA, the Employer shall indemnify and hold harm-\\nless the Prototype Document Sponsor, its ofï¬\\x81 cers, directors, \\nemployees, agents, heirs, executors, successors, and assigns, from \\nand against any and all liabilities, damages, judgments, settlements, \\nlosses, costs, charges, or expenses (including legal expenses) at any \\ntime arising out of or incurred in connection with any action taken by \\nsuch parties in the performance of their duties with respect to this \\nPlan, unless there has been a ï¬\\x81 nal adjudication of gross negligence or \\nwillful misconduct in the performance of such duties. Further, except as \\nmay be otherwise provided by ERISA, the Employer will indemnify the \\nPrototype Document Sponsor from any liability, claim, or expense \\n(including legal expense) that the Prototype Document Sponsor incurs \\nby reason of, or which results in whole or in part from, the reliance of \\nthe Prototype Document Sponsor on the facts and other directions and \\nelections the Employer, Plan Administrator, or Investment Fiduciary \\ncommunicates or fails to communicate.\\n\\n7.25 Military Service\\n\\nNotwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, \\nbeneï¬\\x81 ts, and service credit with respect to qualiï¬\\x81 ed military service will \\nbe provided in accordance with Code section 414(u), including, but not \\nlimited to the following.\\n\\nS\\ne\\nc\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n\\nA.  Beneï¬\\x81 t Accrual in the Case of Death or Disability Resulting from \\nActive Military Service.\\n\\n1.  Beneï¬\\x81 t Accrualâ\\x80\\x94If elected in the Adoption Agreement, for beneï¬\\x81 t \\n\\naccrual purposes, an individual who dies or becomes disabled while \\nperforming qualiï¬\\x81 ed military service (as deï¬\\x81 ned in Code section \\n414(u)) will be treated as if the individual resumed employment in \\naccordance with the individualâ\\x80\\x99s reemployment rights under the \\nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of \\n1994 (USERRA), on the day preceding death or Disability (as appli-\\ncable) and terminated employment on the actual date of death or \\nDisability. If the Employer elects to treat an individual as having \\nresumed employment as described above, subject to items (2) and \\n(3) below, any full or partial compliance by the Plan with respect to \\nthe beneï¬\\x81 t accrual requirements will be treated for purposes of Code \\nsection 414(u)(1) as if such compliance were required under USERRA. \\n\\n2.  Nondiscrimination Requirementâ\\x80\\x94Part A, item (1) above will only \\napply if all individuals performing qualiï¬\\x81 ed military service with \\nrespect to the Employer (as determined under Code sections 414(b), \\n(c), (m), and (o)) who die or became disabled as a result of perform-\\ning qualiï¬\\x81 ed military service (as deï¬\\x81 ned in Code section 414(u)) \\nbefore reemployment by the Employer are credited with service and \\nbeneï¬\\x81 ts on reasonably equivalent terms.\\n\\n3.

If the Employer elects to treat an individual as having \\nresumed employment as described above, subject to item (2) below, \\ncompliance by the Plan with respect to the vesting requirements will \\nbe treated for purposes of Code section 414(u)(1) as if such compli-\\nance were required under USERRA.\\n\\n2.  Nondiscrimination Requirementsâ\\x80\\x94Part B, item (1) above will apply to \\nthe extent permitted under other applicable rules, including the rules \\nprovided in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(a)(4)-11(d)(3), which \\nprovides nondiscrimination rules for crediting imputed service.

Notwithstanding \\nany provision hereof regarding the responsibilities of or granting powers \\nto the Custodian, the Custodian will serve as a nondiscretionary, directed \\nCustodian of the Fund, will have no discretionary authority with respect to \\nthe management or administration of the Plan or the Fund, and will act \\nonly as directed by the entity or individual who has such authority. \\n\\nA.  Responsibilities of the Custodianâ\\x80\\x94The Custodianâ\\x80\\x99s responsibilities \\nmay be further limited by the Plan Trustee(s) and, notwithstanding any \\nprovision hereof to the contrary, may also be further limited by the \\nterms of a separate agreement between the Custodian and the Adopting \\nEmployer. Subject to the previous sentence, the responsibilities of the \\nCustodian will be limited to the following.\\n\\n1.  To receive Plan contributions and to hold, invest and reinvest, and \\ndistribute the Fund as authorized by the Adopting Employer or its \\ndesignee without distinction between principal and interest; pro-\\nvided, however, that nothing in this Plan will require the Custodian to \\nmaintain physical custody of stock certiï¬\\x81 cates (or other indicia of \\nownership of any type of asset) representing assets within the Fund.\\n\\n2.  To maintain accurate records of contributions, investments, earn-\\n\\nings, receipts, disbursements, withdrawals, and other transactions \\nwith respect to the Fund, and all accounts, books, and records \\nrelating thereto will be open at all reasonable times to inspection \\nand audit by any person designated by the Employer; provided, \\nhowever, that the Custodian is given reasonable advance notice of \\nsuch inspection by the Employer. On direction of the Adopting \\nEmployer or Plan Administrator, and if agreed to in writing by the \\nCustodian, the Custodian may provide annual or interim account-\\nings, valuations, or other reports concerning the assets of the \\ncustodial account subject to payment of all required additional fees \\nfor such reports. The Custodianâ\\x80\\x99s accounting will be at the \\nCustodial Account level rather than the Participant level, and the \\nCustodian will not be responsible for Participant-level record-keep-\\ning, reporting, or communication unless it agrees to do so in a \\nseparate written agreement with the Adopting Employer or Plan \\nAdministrator. The Custodian will also furnish the Adopting Employer \\nwith such other information as the Custodian possesses and which \\nis necessary for the Adopting Employer to comply with the reporting \\nrequirements of ERISA, as applicable. An accounting will be deemed \\nto have been approved by the Adopting Employer unless the \\nAdopting Employer or Plan Administrator objects to the contents of \\nan accounting within sixty (60) days of its mailing or electronic \\ntransmission by the Custodian. Any objections must set forth the \\nspeciï¬\\x81 c grounds on which they are based. Upon approval, the \\nCustodian will be forever released from any and all liability with \\nrespect to the Account.\\n\\n3.  To make disbursements from the Fund to Participants or \\n\\nBeneï¬\\x81 ciaries upon the proper authorization of the Plan \\nAdministrator.\\n\\n4.  To furnish to the Plan Administrator an annual statement that \\n\\nreï¬\\x82 ects the value of the investments in the custody of the \\nCustodian as of the end of the period and as of any other times as \\nthe Custodian and Plan Administrator may agree to in writing, \\nincluding an agreement regarding the application of additional fees \\nfor such additional report.\\n\\n5.  To invest the Fund only in investment options selected by the \\n\\nInvestment Fiduciary. Such selection will be made from among the \\ntypes of property that the Prototype Document Sponsor makes \\navailable in Plan Section 7.22(D). Notwithstanding the ï¬\\x81 rst sentence \\nof Section 7.22(D), the Prototype Document Sponsor and not the \\nCustodian is responsible for choosing to make such investments \\navailable for investment and for determining the fair market value of \\neach such investment, and the Custodian has determined only that \\nit is functionally and operationally willing and able to provide its \\nservices hereunder with respect thereto. The Investment Fiduciary \\nwill be responsible for ensuring compliance with all conditions, \\nlimitations, and restrictions concerning investment in any invest-\\nment option. The Custodian shall place monies or other property \\nreceived by it in such permitted investments as the Custodian will \\nbe directed from time to time by instructions of the Investment \\nFiduciary (or Participant, if applicable) provided to it. If Participant \\ndirection in Plan Section 7.22(B) has been selected, the investment \\ninstructions of the Participants will be aggregated and delivered to \\nthe Custodian by the Plan Administrator or its agent. In the absence \\nof Participant direction, the investment instructions of the appropri-\\nate Investment Fiduciary will be delivered to the Custodian by the \\nPlan Administrator or its agent. The Custodian may hold the assets \\nattributable to the Fund in omnibus accounts with assets of other \\nretirement plans for which the Custodian serves as custodian or \\ntrustee. Nothing herein will preclude the Investment Fiduciary from \\notherwise investing any Plan assets as permitted by the Plan, but \\nthe Custodian will not be Custodian or Trustee thereof or have any \\nduties or responsibilities with respect thereto.\\n\\n6.  The Custodian is not obligated to place orders for the investment of \\n\\nthe Fund if sufï¬\\x81 cient cash is not available in the Fund for use in \\nplacing such orders. The Custodian is authorized, but is not obli-\\ngated, to advance funds or to arrange for another ï¬\\x81 nancial organiza-\\ntion (which may be an afï¬\\x81 liate of the Custodian) to advance funds \\nfrom time to time for the purchase of investment assets, for distribu-\\ntions from the Fund and for other purposes before receipt of suf-\\nï¬\\x81 cient funds (whether contributions or proceeds of the liquidation of \\nother investments). All such advances will be made subject to the \\nrequirements of ERISA and the rules, regulations, rulings, and inter-\\npretations thereunder, including but not limited to the U.S. \\nDepartment of Laborâ\\x80\\x99s Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption \\n80-26, as amended from time to time. If sufï¬\\x81 cient funds to repay any \\nsuch advance are not received by the following business day, the \\nCustodian may, in its discretion, then or at any time thereafter before \\nsuch repayment, sell, redeem, or otherwise liquidate any assets of \\nthe Fund in order to repay such advance. Any gain realized upon such \\nliquidation, after payment of any related costs and expenses, will \\nbelong to the Plan. The Employer shall reimburse the Custodian on \\ndemand for any portion of any such advance and the related costs \\nand expenses not repaid from the proceeds of the liquidation.\\n\\n7.  The Custodian shall keep such portion of the Fund in cash or cash \\n\\nbalances as may be directed from time to time by the applicable \\nInvestment Fiduciary. The Custodian will not be liable for any interest \\non any cash balances so maintained nor for interest on any cash or \\ncash balances maintained in the Fund pending investment in accor-\\ndance with appropriate directions. Monies being transferred to and \\ndisbursed by the Custodian may be held in non-interest bearing \\ntransaction accounts in ï¬\\x81 nancial organizations selected by the \\nCustodian (which may be afï¬\\x81 liates of the Custodian) for purposes of \\ncollections and processing transfers and disbursements. The \\nCustodian may transfer monies from the Fund to such accounts \\nbefore issuance of wire transfer orders or checks, drafts, or other \\ninstruments payable from such accounts. The Custodian will not \\nexercise its powers in Plan Section 8.01(B)(1) except pursuant to the \\ninstructions of the Investment Fiduciary transmitted to the Custodian.\\n\\n8.  Should the Investment Fiduciary instruct the Custodian to use the \\n\\nservices of any broker, dealer, employee, or representative of either, \\nor any other person (â\\x80\\x9cBrokerâ\\x80\\x9d) to render services to the Fund, or \\nshould the Custodian require the services of such persons in order \\nto fulï¬\\x81 ll its obligations pursuant to the Plan, the applicable \\nInvestment Fiduciary will be solely responsible for the selection or \\n\\n32 Individual 401(k) Basic Plan Document\\n\\n\\x0cdesignation of such Broker and will be solely responsible for the \\nacts of such Broker. The Custodian shall fully comply with the writ-\\nten instructions, if of a continuing nature, until revoked.', 'Notwithstanding the provisions of Plan Section 5.11, in connection \\nwith the disbursement of assets from the Fund to a Participant, the \\nCustodian shall withhold and remit to the IRS and other applicable \\ntaxing authorities the amount of any income tax withholding required \\nby law pursuant to instructions provided by the Plan Administrator.\\n\\nS\\ne\\nc\\nt\\ni\\no\\nn\\n \\n1\\n\\n9. \\n\\nIn connection with payments and disbursements made from the \\nFund for any purpose, the Custodian shall be responsible for issuing \\nchecks or drafts to such parties and for such amounts as the Plan \\nAdministrator will instruct. The Custodian will be fully protected in \\nmaking such payments pursuant to such instructions from time to \\ntime and will be charged with no responsibility whatsoever respect-\\ning the purposes or propriety of such payments or the application of \\nsuch monies.\\n\\n10. The Custodian shall provide any materials received by it relating to \\nvoting securities to the applicable Investment Fiduciary, which will \\nbe responsible for voting securities or arranging for such securities \\nto be voted in accordance with the Plan and applicable law. It is \\nunderstood that the Custodian will exercise the powers described in \\nPlan Section 8.01(B) only pursuant to instructions of the Investment \\nFiduciary transmitted to the Custodian.\\n\\n11. The Custodian shall determine or have determined the value of the \\n\\nFund as of each Valuation Date. The Custodian shall rely exclu-\\nsively upon, and will not be responsible for, share and unit values \\nestablished by third parties, or unit values established by the \\nCustodian in its capacity as a mutual fund recordkeeper, transfer \\nagent, or Custodian to the extent that the Custodian establishes \\nsuch unit values in reliance on third-party information, including, \\nbut not limited to:\\n\\na.  in connection with mutual funds, the net asset value reported to \\n\\nthe Custodian by such mutual funds or the transfer or other agents \\nof such mutual funds or any generally recognized pricing service;\\n\\nb.  in connection with bank collective funds, the unit value as reported \\n\\nby the trustee of such funds or its agent;\\n\\nc.  in connection with policies and contracts with insurance companies \\n\\nor other ï¬\\x81 nancial institutions, the book value or other value \\nascribed to such policies or contracts by the insurance company or \\nits agent or other ï¬\\x81 nancial organization or its agent; and\\n\\nd.  in connection with publicly traded securities, the market price of such \\n\\nsecurities as reported to the public in a generally available form.', 'The Custodian will have no liability from the failure or delay of any \\npricing source to provide a valuation as of any Valuation Date. If \\nvalues for any investment of the Fund are not generally available, the \\nCustodian shall rely upon instructions provided to it by the applicable \\nInvestment Fiduciary as to valuation procedures. With respect to the \\nportion of the Fund that is invested by an investment manager or \\nother named ï¬\\x81 duciary, the Custodian may conclusively rely upon the \\nvalue of any securities or other property in that portion of the custo-\\ndial account as reported to the Custodian by the investment man-\\nager or other named ï¬\\x81 duciary, for all purposes hereunder. \\n\\n12. All records maintained by the Custodian with respect to the Fund \\nwill be held for such period as may be required under applicable \\nlaw. Upon the expiration of any such required retention period, the \\nCustodian will have the right to destroy such records. The Custodian \\nwill have the right to preserve all records and accounts in original \\nform, electronically, or on microï¬\\x81 lm, magnetic tape, or any other \\nsimilar process pursuant to applicable federal law and subsequent \\nrules promulgated by the IRS or DOL.\\n\\n13. Except as provided below, the Custodian will conclusively presume \\nthat the Employer, Trustee, Plan Administrator, or other responsible \\nparty has made all ï¬\\x81 lings required by law as of the date required. \\nShould the Custodian incur any liability by reason of any partyâ\\x80\\x99s failure \\nto timely ï¬\\x81 le, the Employer shall indemnify and hold the Custodian, \\nany parent, subsidiary, related corporation, or afï¬\\x81 liate of the \\nCustodian, including their respective directors, managers, ofï¬\\x81 cers, \\nemployees, and agents harmless for any and all liabilities, costs, \\nexpenses (including reasonable attorneyâ\\x80\\x99s fees), and other obligations, \\nincluding penalties and interest, incurred by the Custodian.\\n\\n14.
